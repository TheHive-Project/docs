# Important Update: New Documentation Site

Dear valued users,

We want to inform you of an important update regarding our technical documentation for the TheHive, Cortex and all their ecosystem. 
As part of our commitment to deliver the best user experience, we have merged all the technical documentation on one single site.

Get access to the latest and up-to-date documentation by visiting <a href=https://docs.strangebee.com>https://docs.strangebee.com</a>.


## Notes

* The older documentation, for TheHive version 4, will remain available until december 31st, 2023.
* After december 31st, 2023, this site will be permanently retired, and all visitors will be redirected to <a href=https://docs.strangebee.com>https://docs.strangebee.com</a>.
