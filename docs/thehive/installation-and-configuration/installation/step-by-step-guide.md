# Step-by-Step guide

This page is a step by step installation and configuration guide to get an TheHive 4 instance up and running. This guide is illustrated with examples for Debian and RPM packages based systems and for installation from binary packages.


## Java Virtual Machine

!!! Example ""

    === "Debian"

        ```bash
        apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jre-headless
        echo JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64" >> /etc/environment
        export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
        ```

    === "RPM"
    
        ```bash
        yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless.x86_64
        echo JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0" >> /etc/environment
        export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0"
        ```

    === "Other"

        The installation requires Java 8, so refer to your system documentation to install it.


!!! Note
    TheHive can be loaded by Java 11, but not the stable version of Cassandra, which still requires Java 8. 
    If you set up a cluster for the database distinct from TheHive servers:

      - Cassandra nodes can be loaded by Java 8
      - TheHive nodes can be loaded by Java 11 
    
    For standalone servers, with TheHive and Cassandra on the same OS, we recommend having only Java 8 installed for both applications.

## Cassandra database

Apache Cassandra is a scalable and high available database. TheHive supports the latest stable version  **3.11.x** of Cassandra.

### Install from repository

!!! Example ""
    === "Debian"
        
        1. Add Apache repository references

            ```bash
            curl -fsSL https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -
            echo "deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 311x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
            ```

        2. Install the package

            ```bash
            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install cassandra
            ```


    === "RPM"

        1. Add the Apache repository of Cassandra to `/etc/yum.repos.d/cassandra.repo`

            ```bash
            [cassandra]
            name=Apache Cassandra
            baseurl=https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/redhat/311x/
            gpgcheck=1
            repo_gpgcheck=1
            gpgkey=https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/KEYS
            ```

        2. Install the package

            ```bash
            yum install -y cassandra
            ```

    === "Other"

        Download and untgz archive from http://cassandra.apache.org/download/ in the folder of your choice.
    

By default, data is stored in `/var/lib/cassandra`.


### Configuration

Start by changing the `cluster_name` with `thp`. Run the command `cqlsh`: 

```bash
cqlsh localhost 9042
```

```sql
cqlsh> UPDATE system.local SET cluster_name = 'thp' where key='local';
```

Exit and then run:

```bash
nodetool flush
```

Configure Cassandra by editing `/etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml` file.


```yml
# content from /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml

cluster_name: 'thp'
listen_address: 'xx.xx.xx.xx' # address for nodes
rpc_address: 'xx.xx.xx.xx' # address for clients
seed_provider:
    - class_name: org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
      parameters:
          # Ex: "<ip1>,<ip2>,<ip3>"
          - seeds: 'xx.xx.xx.xx' # self for the first node
data_file_directories:
  - '/var/lib/cassandra/data'
commitlog_directory: '/var/lib/cassandra/commitlog'
saved_caches_directory: '/var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches'
hints_directory: 
  - '/var/lib/cassandra/hints'
```

Then restart the service:

!!! Example ""
    === "Debian"

        ```bash
        service cassandra restart
        ```

    === "RPM"

        Run the service and ensure it restart after a reboot:

        ```bash
        systemctl daemon-reload
        service cassandra start
        chkconfig cassandra on
        ```

        !!! Warning
            Cassandra service does not start well with the new systemd version. There is an existing issue and a fix on Apache website: [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-15273]()

By default Cassandra listens on `7000/tcp` (inter-node), `9042/tcp` (client).

#### Additional configuration

For additional configuration options, refer to:

- [Cassandra documentation page](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/configuring.html)
- [Datastax documentation page](https://docs.datastax.com/en/ddac/doc/datastax_enterprise/config/configTOC.html)


#### Security

#### Add nodes

To add Cassandra nodes, refer the the [related administration guide](../architecture/3_nodes_cluster.md).

## Indexing engine

Starting from TheHive 4.1.0, a solution to store data indexes is required. These indexes should be unique and the same for all nodes of TheHive cluster. 

- TheHive embed a Lucene engine you can use for standalone server
- For clusters setups, an instance of Elasticsearch is required 

!!! Example ""
    === "Local lucene engine"

        Create a folder dedicated to host indexes for TheHive: 

        ```bash
        mkdir -p /opt/thp/thehive/index
        ```
        
        Later, after having installed TheHive, ensure the user `thehive` owns the path chosen for storing the indexes:

        ```
        chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp/thehive/index
        ```

    === "Elasticsearch"

        Use an existing Elasticsearch instance or install a new one. This instance should be reachable by all nodes of a cluster.

        !!! Warning
            Elasticsearch configuration should use the default value for `script.allowed_types`, or contain the following configuration line: 

            ```yaml
            script.allowed_types: inline,stored
            ```


!!! Note
    - Indexes will be created at the first start of TheHive. It can take a certain amount of time, depending the size of the database
    - Like data and files, indexes should be part of the backup policy
    - Indexes can removed and created again



## File storage

Files uploaded in TheHive (in *task logs* or in *observables*) can be stores in localsystem, in a Hadoop filesystem (recommended) or in the graph database.

For standalone production and test servers , we recommends using local filesystem. If you think about building a cluster with TheHive, you have several possible solutions: using Hadoop or S3 services ; see the [related guide](../architecture/3_nodes_cluster.md) for more details and an example with MinIO servers.  

!!! Example ""
    === "Local Filesystem"

        !!! Warning
            This option is perfect **for standalone servers**. If you intend to build a cluster for your instance of TheHive 4 we recommend:
            
            - using a NFS share, common to all nodes
            - having a look at storage solutions implementing S3 or HDFS.

        To store files on the local filesystem, start by choosing the dedicated folder:

        ```bash
        mkdir -p /opt/thp/thehive/files
        ```

        This path will be used in the configuration of TheHive.

        Later, after having installed TheHive, ensure the user `thehive` owns the path chosen for storing files:

        ```
        chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp/thehive/files
        ```

    === "S3 with Min.io"

        An example of installing, configuring and use Min.IO is detailed in [this documentation](../architecture/3_nodes_cluster.md).

    === "HDFS with Hadoop"

        An example of installing, configuring and use Apache Hadoop is detailed in [this documentation](./hadoop.md).



## TheHive

This part contains instructions to install TheHive and then configure it.

!!! Warning
    TheHive4 can't be installed on the same server than older versions. We recommend installing it on a new server, especially if a migration is foreseen.

### Installation

All packages are published on our packages repository. We support Debian and RPM packages as well as binary packages (zip archive). All packages are signed using our GPG key [562CBC1C](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/master/PGP-PUBLIC-KEY). Its fingerprint is `0CD5 AC59 DE5C 5A8E 0EE1  3849 3D99 BB18 562C BC1C`.

!!! Example ""

    === "Debian"
 
        ```bash
        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/master/PGP-PUBLIC-KEY | sudo apt-key add -
        ```
 
    === "RPM"

        ```bash
        sudo rpm --import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/master/PGP-PUBLIC-KEY
        ```

We also release stable and beta version of the applications.

#### Stable versions

Install TheHive 4.x package of the stable version by using the following commands:

!!! Example ""

    === "Debian"

        ```bash
        echo 'deb https://deb.thehive-project.org release main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/thehive-project.list
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install thehive4
        ```

    === "RPM"
        1. Setup your system to connect the RPM repository. Create and edit the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/thehive-project.repo`:

            ```bash
            [thehive-project]
            enabled=1
            priority=1
            name=TheHive-Project RPM repository
            baseurl=https://rpm.thehive-project.org/release/noarch
            gpgcheck=1
            ```

        2. Then install the package using `yum`:

            ```bash
            yum install thehive4
            ```
    
    === "Other"

        1. Download and unzip the chosen binary package. TheHive files can be installed wherever you want on the filesystem. In this guide, we assume you have chosen to install them under `/opt`.

        ```bash
        cd /opt
        wget https://download.thehive-project.org/thehive4-latest.zip
        unzip thehive4-latest.zip
        ln -s thehive4-x.x.x thehive
        ```

        2. Prepare the system

            It is recommended to use a dedicated, non-privileged user account to start TheHive. If so, make sure that the chosen account can create log files in `/opt/thehive/logs`.

            If you'd rather start the application as a service, use the following commands:

            ```bash
            addgroup thehive
            adduser --system thehive
            chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thehive
            mkdir /etc/thehive
            touch /etc/thehive/application.conf
            chown root:thehive /etc/thehive
            chgrp thehive /etc/thehive/application.conf
            chmod 640 /etc/thehive/application.conf
            ```

            Copy the systemd script in `/etc/systemd/system/thehive.service`.

            ```bash
            cd /tmp
            wget https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/blob/master/package/thehive.service
            cp thehive.service /etc/systemd/system/thehive.service
            ```


#### Beta versions

To install beta versions of TheHive4, use the following setup:

!!! Example ""

    === "Debian"

        ```bash
        echo 'deb https://deb.thehive-project.org beta main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/thehive-project.list
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install thehive4
        ```

    === "RPM"

        1. setup your system to connect the RPM repository. Create and edit the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/thehive-project.repo`:

            ```bash
            [thehive-project]
            enabled=1
            priority=1
            name=TheHive-Project RPM repository
            baseurl=https://rpm.thehive-project.org/beta/noarch
            gpgcheck=1
            ```

        2. Then install the package using `yum`:

            ```bash
            yum install thehive4
            ```

    === "Other"

        1. Download and unzip the chosen binary package. TheHive files can be installed wherever you want on the filesystem. In this guide, we assume you have chosen to install them under `/opt`.

            ```bash
            cd /opt
            wget https://download.thehive-project.org/thehive4-beta-latest.zip
            unzip thehive4-beta-latest.zip
            ln -s thehive4-x.x.x thehive
            ```
        
        2. Prepare the system

            It is recommended to use a dedicated, non-privileged user account to start TheHive. If so, make sure that the chosen account can create log files in `/opt/thehive/logs`.

            If you'd rather start the application as a service, use the following commands:

            ```bash
            addgroup thehive
            adduser --system thehive
            chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thehive
            mkdir /etc/thehive
            touch /etc/thehive/application.conf
            chown root:thehive /etc/thehive
            chgrp thehive /etc/thehive/application.conf
            chmod 640 /etc/thehive/application.conf
            ```

            Copy the systemd script in `/etc/systemd/system/thehive.service`.

            ```bash
            cd /tmp
            wget https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive/blob/master/package/thehive.service
            cp thehive.service /etc/systemd/system/thehive.service
            ```

!!! Warning

    We recommend using or playing with Beta version **for testing purpose only**.


### Configuration

Following configurations are required to start TheHive successfully:

- Secret key configuration
- Database configuration
- File storage configuration

#### Secret key configuration

!!! Example ""

    === "Debian"
        The secret key is automatically generated and stored in `/etc/thehive/secret.conf` by package installation script.

    === "RPM"
        The secret key is automatically generated and stored in `/etc/thehive/secret.conf` by package installation script.

    === "Other"
        Setup a secret key in the `/etc/thehive/secret.conf` file by running the following command:

        ```bash
        cat > /etc/thehive/secret.conf << _EOF_
        play.http.secret.key="$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 64 | head -n 1)"
        _EOF_
        ```

#### Database

To use Cassandra database, TheHive configuration file (`/etc/thehive/application.conf`) has to be edited and updated with following lines:

```yaml
db {
  provider: janusgraph
  janusgraph {
    storage {
      backend: cql
      hostname: ["127.0.0.1"] # seed node ip addresses
      #username: "<cassandra_username>"       # login to connect to database (if configured in Cassandra)
      #password: "<cassandra_passowrd"
      cql {
        cluster-name: thp       # cluster name
        keyspace: thehive           # name of the keyspace
        local-datacenter: datacenter1   # name of the datacenter where TheHive runs (relevant only on multi datacenter setup)
        # replication-factor: 2 # number of replica
        read-consistency-level: ONE
        write-consistency-level: ONE
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Indexes

Update `db.storage` configuration part in `/etc/thehive/application.conf` accordingly to your setup. 

!!! Example "" 
    === "Lucene"

        If your setup is a standalone server or you are using a common NFS share, configure TheHive like this:  

        ```yaml
        db {
          provider: janusgraph
          janusgraph {
            storage {
              [..]
            }
            ## Index configuration
            index.search {
              backend : lucene
              directory:  /opt/thp/thehive/index
            }
          }
        }
        ```

    === "Elasticsearch" 

        If you decided to have access to a centralised index with Elasticsearch, configure TheHive like this:  

        ```yaml
        db {
          provider: janusgraph
          janusgraph {
            storage {
              [..]
            }
            ## Index configuration
            index.search {
              backend : elasticsearch
              hostname : ["10.1.2.20"]
              index-name : thehive
            }
          }
        }
        ```


#### Filesystem


!!! Example ""

    === "Local filesystem"

        If you chose to store files on the local filesystem:

        1. Ensure permission of the folder

            ```bash
            chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp/thehive/files
            ```

        2. add following lines to TheHive configuration file (`/etc/thehive/application.conf`)

            ```yml
            ## Storage configuration
            storage {
            provider = localfs
            localfs.location = /opt/thp/thehive/files
            }
            ```

    === "S3"
        If you chose MinIO and a S3 object storage system to store files in a  filesystem, add following lines to TheHive configuration file (`/etc/thehive/application.conf`)

        ```yaml
        ## Storage configuration
        storage {
          provider: s3
          s3 {
            bucket = "thehive"
            readTimeout = 1 minute
            writeTimeout = 1 minute
            chunkSize = 1 MB
            endpoint = "http://<IP_ADDRESS>:9100"
            accessKey = "<MINIO ACCESS KEY>"
            secretKey = "<MINIO SECRET KEY>"
          }
        }
        ```

    === "HDFS"
        If you chose Apache Hadoop and a HDFS filesystem to store files in a distrubuted filesystem, add following lines to TheHive configuration file (`/etc/thehive/application.conf`)

        ```yaml
        ## Storage configuration
        storage {
          provider: hdfs
          hdfs {
            root: "hdfs://thehive1:10000" # namenode server
            location: "/thehive"
            username: thehive
          }
        }
        ```

### Run

Save configuration file and run the service:


```bash
service thehive start
```

Please note that the service may take some time to start. Once it is started, you may launch your browser and connect to `http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:9000/`.

The default admin user is `admin@thehive.local` with password `secret`. It is recommended to change the default password.


## Advanced configuration
For additional configuration options, please refer to the [Configuration Guides](../index.md#configuration-guides).
