The following guide describe the Cortex 2 API to allow developers to interface the powerful observable analysis engine with other SIRPs (Security Incident Response Platforms) besides TheHive, TIPs (Threat Intelligence Platforms), SIEMs or scripts. Please note that the Web UI of Cortex 2 exclusively leverage the REST API to interact with the back-end. Note : You can use Cortex4py , the Python library we provide, to facilitate interaction with the REST API of Cortex. You need Cortex4py 2.0.0 or later as earlier versions are not compatible with Cortex 2. All the exposed APIs share the same request & response formats and authentication strategies as described below. There are also some transverse parameters supported by several calls, in addition to utility APIs . If you want to create an analyzer, please read the How to Write and Submit an Analyzer guide. Request & Response Formats # Cortex accepts several parameter formats within a HTTP request. They can be used indifferently. Input data can be: A query string A URL-encoded form A multi-part JSON Hence, the requests shown below are equivalent. Query String # curl -XPOST 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/login?user=me&password=secret' URL-encoded Form # curl -XPOST 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/login' -d user = me -d password = secret JSON # curl -XPOST https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"user\": \"me\", \"password\": \"secret\" }' Multi-part # curl -XPOST https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/login -F '_json=<-;type=application/json' << _EOF_ { \"user\": \"me\", \"password\": \"secret\" } _EOF_ Response Format # For each request submitted, Cortex will respond back with JSON data. For example, if the authentication request is successful, Cortex should return the following output: { \"id\" : \"me\" , \"name\" : \"me\" , \"roles\" :[ \"read\" , \"analyze\" , \"orgadmin\" ]} If not, Cortex should return an authentication error: { \"type\" : \"AuthenticationError\" , \"message\" : \"Authentication failure\" } Authentication # Most API calls require authentication. Credentials can be provided using a session cookie , an API key or directly using HTTP basic authentication (if this method is specifically enabled). Session cookies are better suited for browser authentication. Hence, we recommend authenticating with API keys when calling the Cortex APIs. Generating API Keys with an orgAdmin Account # API keys can be generated using the Web UI. To do so, connect using an orgAdmin account then click on Organization and then on the Create API Key button in the row corresponding to the user you intend to use for API authentication. Once the API key has been created, click on Reveal to display the API key then click on the copy to clipboard button if you wish to copy the key to your system's clipboard. If the user is not yet created, start by clicking on Add user to create it then follow the steps mentioned above. Generating API Keys with a superAdmin Account # You can use a superAdmin account to achieve the same result as described above. Once authenticated, click on Users then on the Create API Key button in the row corresponding to the user you intend to use for API authentication. Please make sure the user is in the right organization by thoroughly reading its name, which is shown below the user name. Once the API key has been created, click on Reveal to display the API key then click on the copy to clipboard button if you wish to copy the key to your system's clipboard. Authenticating with an API Key # Once you have generated an API key you can use it, for example, to list the Cortex jobs thanks to the following curl command: # Using API key curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/job As you can see in the example above, we instructed curl to add the Authorization header to the request. The value of the header is Bearer: **API_KEY** . So if your API key is GPX20GUAQWwpqnhA6JpOwNGPMfWuxsX3 , the curl command above would look like the following: # Using API key curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer GPX20GUAQWwpqnhA6JpOwNGPMfWuxsX3' https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/job Using Basic Authentication # Cortex also supports basic authentication but it is disabled by default for security reasons. If you absolutely need to use it , you can enable it by adding auth.method.basic=true to the configuration file ( /etc/cortex/application.conf by default). Once you do, restart the Cortex service. You can then, for example, list the Cortex jobs using the following curl command: # Using basic authentication curl -u mylogin:mypassword https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/job Organization APIs # Cortex offers a set of APIs to create, update and list organizations. Organization Model # An organization (org) is defined by the following attributes: Attribute Description Type id Copy of the org's name (see next row) readonly name Name readonly status Status ( Active or Locked ) writable description Description writable createdAt Creation date computed createdBy User who created the org computed updatedAt Last update computed updatedBy User who last updated the org computed Please note that id and name are essentially the same. Also, createdAt and updatedAt are in epoch . List # It is possible to list all the organizations using the following API call, which requires the API key associated with a superAdmin account: curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization' You can also search/filter organizations using the following query: curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization/_search' -d '{ \"query\": {\"status\": \"Active\"} }' Both APIs supports the range and sort query parameters described in paging and sorting details . Create # It is possible to create an organization using the following API call, which requires the API key associated with a superAdmin account: curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization' -d '{ \"name\": \"demo\", \"description\": \"Demo organization\", \"status\": \"Active\" }' Update # You can update an organization's description and status ( Active or Locked ) using the following API call. This requires the API key associated with a superAdmin account: curl -XPATCH -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization/ORG_ID' -d '{ \"description\": \"New Demo organization\", }' or curl -XPATCH -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization/ORG_ID' -d '{ \"status\": \"Active\", }' Delete # Deleting an organization just marks it as Locked and doesn't remove the associated data from the DB. To \"delete\" an organization, you can use the API call shown below. It requires the API key associated with a superAdmin account. curl -XDELETE -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization/ORG_ID' Obtain Details # This API call returns the details of an organization as described in the Organization model section. curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization/ORG_ID' Let's assume that the organization we are seeking to obtain details about is called demo . The curl command would be: curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization/demo' and it should return: { \"id\" : \"demo\" , \"name\" : \"demo\" , \"status\" : \"Active\" , \"description\" : \"Demo organization\" , \"createdAt\" : 1520258040437 , \"createdBy\" : \"superadmin\" , \"updatedBy\" : \"superadmin\" , \"updatedAt\" : 1522077420693 } List Users # As mentioned above, you can use the API to return the list of all the users declared withing an organization. For that purpose, use the API call shown below with the API key of an orgAdmin or superAdmin account. It supports the range and sort query parameters declared in paging and sorting details . curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization/ORG_ID/user' and should return a list of users . If one wants to filter/search for some users (active ones for example), there is a search API to use as below: curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/organization/ORG_ID/user/_search' -d '{ \"query\": {} }' It also supports the range and sort query parameters declared in paging and sorting details . List Enabled Analyzers # To list the analyzers that have been enabled within an organization, use the following API call with the API key of an orgAdmin user: curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/analyzer' It should return a list of Analyzers . Please note that this API call does not display analyzers that are disabled. It supports the range and sort query parameters declared in paging and sorting details . User APIs # The following section describes the APIs that allow creating, updating and listing users within an organization. User Model # A user is defined by the following attributes: Attribute Description Type id ID/login readonly name Name writable roles Roles. Possible values are: read , read,analyze , read,analyze,orgadmin and superadmin writable status Status ( Active or Locked ) writable organization organization to which the user belongs (set upon account creation) readonly createdAt Creation date computed createdBy User who created the account computed updatedAt Last update date computed updatedBy User who last updated the account computed hasKey true when the user has an API key computed hasPassword true if the user has a password computed List All # This API call allows a superAdmin to list and search all the users of all defined organizations: curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/user' This call supports the range and sort query parameters declared in paging and sorting details . List Users within an Organization # This call is described in organization APIs . Search # This API call allows a superAdmin to perform search on the user accounts created in a Cortex instance: curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/user/_search' -d '{ \"query\": {} }' This call supports the range and sort query parameters declared in paging and sorting details Create # This API calls allows you to programmatically create user creation. If the call is made by a superAdmin user, the request must specify the organization to which the user belong in the organization field. If the call is made by an orgAdmin user, the value of organization field must be the same as the user who makes the call: orgAdmin users are allowed to create users only in their organization. curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/user' -d '{ \"name\": \"Demo org Admin\", \"roles\": [ \"read\", \"analyze\", \"orgadmin\" ], \"organization\": \"demo\", \"login\": \"demo\" }' If successful, the call returns a JSON object representing the created user as described above . { \"id\" : \"demo\" , \"organization\" : \"demo\" , \"name\" : \"Demo org Admin\" , \"roles\" : [ \"read\" , \"analyze\" , \"orgadmin\" ], \"status\" : \"Ok\" , \"createdAt\" : 1526050123286 , \"createdBy\" : \"superadmin\" , \"hasKey\" : false , \"hasPassword\" : false } Update # This API call allows updating the writable attributed of a user account. It's available to users with superAdmin or orgAdmin roles. Any user can also use it to update their own information (but obviously not their roles). curl -XPATCH -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/user/USER_LOGIN' -d '{ \"name\": \"John Doe\", \"roles\": [ \"read\", \"analyze\" ], \"status\": \"Locked\" }' It returns a JSON object representing the updated user as described above . Get Details # This call returns the user details. It's available to users with superAdmin roles and to users in the same organization. Every user can also use it to read their own details. curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/user/USER_LOGIN' It returns a JSON object representing the user as described previously . Set a Password # This call sets the user's password. It's available to users with superAdmin or orgAdmin roles. Please note that the request needs to be made using HTTPS with a valid certificate on the server's end to prevent credential sniffing or other PITM (Person-In-The-Middle) attacks. curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/user/USER_LOGIN/password/set' -d '{ \"password\": \"SOMEPASSWORD\" }' If successful, the call returns 204 (success / no content). Change a password # This call allows a given user to change only their own existing password. It is available to all users including superAdmin and orgAdmin ones. Please note that if a superAdmin or an orgAdmin needs to update the password of another user, they must use the /password/set call described in the previous subsection. curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/user/USER_LOGIN/password/change' -d '{ \"currentPassword\": \"password\", \"password\": \"new-password\" }' If successful, the call returns 204 (success / no content). Set and Renew an API Key # This calls allows setting and renewing the API key of a user. It's available to users with superAdmin or orgAdmin roles. Any user can also use it to renew their own API key. Again, the request needs to be made using HTTPS with a valid certificate on the server's end to prevent credential sniffing or other PITM (Person-In-The-Middle) attacks. You know the drill ;-) curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/user/USER_LOGIN/key/renew' If successful, it returns the generated API key in a text/plain response. Get an API Key # This calls allows getting a user's API key. It's available to users with superAdmin or orgAdmin roles. Any user can also use it to obtain their own API key. curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer **API_KEY**' 'https://CORTEX_APP_URL:9001/api/user/USER_LOGIN/key' If successful, the generated API key is returned in text/plain response Revoke an API Key # This calls allow revoking a user's API key.

Writing a Responder # A responder is a program that takes JSON input and do an action and produces a basic result of that action. Responders are very similar to analyzers though they have different purposes. Responders are made of at least 2 types of files: The program itself One or several service interaction files or flavors A Python requirements file, which is only necessary if the responder is written in Python. The Program # The first type of files a responder is made of is the core program that performs actions. It can be written in any programming language that is supported by Linux. you can write your responders in Python, Ruby, Perl or even Scala. However, the very handy Cortexutils library described below is in Python. It greatly facilitates responder development and it also provides some methods to quickly format the output to make it compliant with the JSON schema expected by TheHive . Service Interaction Files (Flavors) # A responder must have at least one service interaction file. Such files contain key configuration information such as the responder's author information, the datatypes ( thehive:case , thehive:alert , ...) the responder accepts as input and to which it applies to if used from TheHive, the TLP and PAP (or Permissible Actions Protocol ) above which it will refuse to execute to protect against data leakage and to enforce sane OPSEC practices and so on. A responder can have two or more service interaction files to allow it to perform different actions. We speak then of flavors. For example, a Mailer responder can send message using several body templates. Python Requirements # If the responder is written in Python, a requirements.txt must be provided with the list of all the dependencies. Example: Mailer Responder Files # Below is a directory listing of the files corresponding to a Mailer responder. responders/Mailer | -- Mailer.json | -- requirements.txt ` -- mailer.py Input # The input of a responder can be any JSON data, even a simple string. The submitter must send data with the structure expected by the program. The acceptable datatypes described in the Service Interaction files indicate what kind of data is expected. For example, if the program requires a thehive:case (i.e. it applies at the case level in TheHive), input must comply with TheHive case. Below an example of thehive:case input. { \"data\" : { \"updatedAt\" : 1606230814019 , \"tlp\" : 2 , \"endDate\" : 1606230814019 , \"description\" : \"Case Description\" , \"tags\" : [ \"tag\" ], \"caseId\" : 157 , \"customFields\" : {}, \"pap\" : 2 , \"status\" : \"Open\" , \"resolutionStatus\" : \"Indeterminate\" , \"createdAt\" : 1606183201646 , \"createdBy\" : \"user\" , \"flag\" : false , \"severity\" : 2 , \"metrics\" : {}, \"owner\" : \"user\" , \"title\" : \"Title\" , \"updatedBy\" : \"user\" , \"startDate\" : 1606183201000 , \"impactStatus\" : \"NotApplicable\" , \"_type\" : \"case\" , \"_routing\" : \"iwD693UBlJefU8pMrqOq\" , \"_parent\" : null , \"_id\" : \"iwD693UBlJefU8pMrqOq\" , \"_seqNo\" : 4572 , \"_primaryTerm\" : 48 , \"id\" : \"iwD693UBlJefU8pMrqOq\" }, \"dataType\" : \"thehive:case\" , \"tlp\" : 2 , \"pap\" : 2 , \"message\" : \"\" , \"parameters\" : { \"user\" : \"user\" }, \"config\" : { \"proxy_https\" : null , \"cacerts\" : null , \"max_pap\" : 2 , \"jobTimeout\" : 30 , \"api_key\" : \"3bDBUb7EL409MHOmXBkqsysZ1vpTab1Q\" , \"check_tlp\" : true , \"proxy_http\" : null , \"max_tlp\" : 2 , \"url\" : \"configured_url\" , \"check_pap\" : true } } In the addition to the input ( data section) sent by the submitter, Cortex adds the config section which is the responder's specific configuration provided by an orgAdmin user when the responder is enabled in the Cortex UI. Example: Service Interaction File for the Mailer Responder # The <== sign and anything after it are comments that do no appear in the original file. { \"name\" : \"Mailer\" , \"version\" : \"1.0\" , \"author\" : \"CERT-BDF\" , \"url\" : \"https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-Analyzers\" , \"license\" : \"AGPL-V3\" , \"description\" : \"Send an email with information from a TheHive case or alert\" , \"dataTypeList\" : [ \"thehive:case\" , \"thehive:alert\" , \"thehive:case_task\" ], \"command\" : \"Mailer/mailer.py\" , \"baseConfig\" : \"Mailer\" , \"configurationItems\" : [ { \"name\" : \"from\" , \"description\" : \"email address from which the mail is send\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , <== de f i nes wha t ki n d o f da ta t ype t he co nf igura t io n i te m is (s tr i n g , nu mber) \"multi\" : false , <== se tt i n g mul t i t o true allows t o pass a lis t o f i te ms \"required\" : true }, { \"name\" : \"smtp_host\" , \"description\" : \"SMTP server used to send mail\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"multi\" : false , \"required\" : true , \"defaultValue\" : \"localhost\" }, { \"name\" : \"smtp_port\" , \"description\" : \"SMTP server port\" , \"type\" : \"number\" , \"multi\" : false , \"required\" : true , \"defaultValue\" : 25 }, { \"name\" : \"smtp_user\" , \"description\" : \"SMTP server user\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"multi\" : false , \"required\" : false , \"defaultValue\" : \"user\" }, { \"name\" : \"smtp_pwd\" , \"description\" : \"SMTP server password\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"multi\" : false , \"required\" : false , \"defaultValue\" : \"pwd\" } ] } Service Interaction Configuration Items # name # Name of the specific service (or flavor) of the responder. If your responder has only one service interaction (i.e. performs only one action), it is the name of the responder's directory. If your responder performs several actions (i.e. comes in several flavors), you have to give a specific and meaningful name to each flavor. Each flavor's name appear in TheHive's responder list and in MISP when you use Cortex for attribute enrichment. version # The version of the responder. You must increase major version numbers when new features are added, modifications are made to take into account API changes, report output is modified or when report templates (more on this later) are updated. You must increase minor version numbers when bugs are fixed. author # You must provide your full name and/or your organization/team name when submitting a responder. Pseudos are not accepted. If you'd rather remain anonymous, please contact us at support@thehive-project.org prior to submitting your responder. url # The URL where the responder is stored. This should ideally be https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-Analyzers license # The license of the code. Ideally, we recommend using the AGPL-v3 license. Make sure your code's license is compatible with the license(s) of the various components and libraries you use if applicable. description # Description of the responder. Please be concise and clear. The description is shown in the Cortex UI and TheHive. dataTypeList # The list of TheHive datatypes supported by the responder. Currently TheHive accepts the following datatypes: thehive:case thehive:case_artifact (i.e. observable) thehive:alert thehive:case_task thehive:case_task_log (i.e. task log) baseConfig # Name used to group configuration items common to several responders. This prevent the user to enter the same API key for all responder flavors. The Cortex responder config page group configuration items by their baseConfig . config # Configuration dedicated to the responder's flavor. This is where we typically specify the TLP level of observables allowed to be analyzed with the check_tlp and max_tlp parameters. For example, if max_tlp is set to 2 (TLP:AMBER), TLP:RED observables cannot be analyzed. max_tlp # The TLP level above which the responder must not be executed. TLP max_tlp value Unknown -1 WHITE 0 GREEN 1 AMBER 2 RED 3 check_tlp # This is a boolean parameter. When true , max_tlp is checked. And if the input's TLP is above max_tlp , the responder is not executed. For consistency reasons, we do recommend setting both check_tlp and max_tlp even if check_tlp is set to false . max_pap # The PAP level above which the responder must not be executed. TLP max_tlp value Unknown -1 WHITE 0 GREEN 1 AMBER 2 RED 3 check_pap # This is a boolean parameter. When true , max_pap is checked. And if the input's PAP is above max_pap , the responder is not executed. For consistency reasons, we do recommend setting both check_pap and max_pap even if check_pap is set to false . command # The command used to run the responder. That's typically the full, absolute path to the main program file. configurationItems # The list of configurationItems is necessary in order to be able to set all configuration variables for responders directly in the Cortex 2 user interface. As in the VirusTotal example above can be seen, every item is a json object that defines: - name (string) - description (string) - type (string) - multi (boolean) - required (boolean) - defaultValue (according to type, optional) The multi parameter allows to pass a list as configuration variable instead of a single string or number. This is used e.g. in the MISP responder that queries multiple servers in one run and needs different parameters for that. Output # The output of a responder depends on the success or failure of its execution. If the responder fails to execute: { \"success\" : false , \"errorMessage\" : \"..\" } When success is set to false , it indicates that something went wrong during the execution. errorMessage is free text - typically the error output message. If the responder succeeds (i.e. it runs without any error): { \"success\" : true , \"full\" :{ \"message\" : \"..\" }, \"operations\" :[] } When success is set to true , it indicates that the responder ran successfully. full is the full report of the responder. It must contain at least a message. operations is a list what the submitter system should execute. As of version 3.1.0, TheHive accepts the following operations: AddTagToArtifact ( { \"type\": \"AddTagToArtifact\", \"tag\": \"tag to add\" } ): add a tag to the artifact related to the object AddTagToCase ( { \"type\": \"AddTagToCase\", \"tag\": \"tag to add\" } ): add a tag to the case related to the object MarkAlertAsRead : mark the alert related to the object as read AddCustomFields ( {\"name\": \"key\", \"value\": \"value\", \"tpe\": \"type\" ): add a custom field to the case related to the object The list of acceptable operations will increase in future releases of TheHive. The Cortexutils Python Library # So far, all the published responders have been written in Python. We provide a Python library called cortexutils to help developers easily write their programs. Note though that Python is not mandatory for responder coding and any language that runs on Linux can be used, though you won't have the benefits of the CortexUtils library. Cortexutils can be used with Python 2 and 3. Due to the end of life from Python2 it is strongly advised to work as much with Python3 as possible. To install it : pip install cortexutils or pip3 install cortexutils This library is already used by all the responders published in our Github repository . Feel free to start reading the code of some of them before writing your own. Submitting a Responder # We highly encourage you to share your responders with the community through our Github repository. To do so, we invite you to follow a few steps before submitting a pull request. Check Existing Issues # Start by checking if an issue already exists for the responder you'd like to write and contribute. Verify that nobody is working on it. If an issue exists and has the in progress , under review or pr-submitted label, it means somebody is already working on the code or has finished it. If you are short on ideas, check issues with a help wanted label . If one of those issues interest you, indicate that you are working on it. Open an Issue # If there's no issue open for the responder you'd like to contribute, open one . Indicate that you are working on it to avoid having someone start coding it. You have to create an issue for each responder you'd like to submit. Review your Service Interaction File(s) # Review your service interaction files. For example, let's check the Mailer JSON responder configuration file(s): { \"name\" : \"Mailer\" , \"version\" : \"1.0\" , \"author\" : \"CERT-BDF\" , \"url\" : \"https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-Analyzers\" , \"license\" : \"AGPL-V3\" , \"description\" : \"Send an email with information from a TheHive case or alert\" , \"dataTypeList\" : [ \"thehive:case\" , \"thehive:alert\" , \"thehive:case_task\" ], \"command\" : \"Mailer/mailer.py\" , \"baseConfig\" : \"Mailer\" , \"configurationItems\" : [ { \"name\" : \"from\" , \"description\" : \"email address from which the mail is send\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , <== de f i nes wha t ki n d o f da ta t ype t he co nf igura t io n i te m is (s tr i n g , nu mber) \"multi\" : false , <== se tt i n g mul t i t o true allows t o pass a lis t o f i te ms \"required\" : true }, { \"name\" : \"smtp_host\" , \"description\" : \"SMTP server used to send mail\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"multi\" : false , \"required\" : true , \"defaultValue\" : \"localhost\" }, { \"name\" : \"smtp_port\" , \"description\" : \"SMTP server port\" , \"type\" : \"number\" , \"multi\" : false , \"required\" : true , \"defaultValue\" : 25 }, { \"name\" : \"smtp_user\" , \"description\" : \"SMTP server user\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"multi\" : false , \"required\" : false , \"defaultValue\" : \"user\" }, { \"name\" : \"smtp_pwd\" , \"description\" : \"SMTP server password\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , \"multi\" : false , \"required\" : false , \"defaultValue\" : \"pwd\" } ] } Ensure that all information is correct and particularly the author and license parameters. Provide the List of Requirements # If your responder is written in Python, make sure to complete the requirements.txt file with the list of all the external libraries that are needed to run the responder correctly. Verify Execution # Use these three simple checks before submitting your responder: Ensure it works with the expected configuration, TLP, PAP or datatype. Ensure it works with missing configuration, PAP, datatype or TLP: your responder must generate an explicit error message.

Writing an Analyzer # An analyzer is a program that takes an observable and configuration information as raw input , analyze the observable and produces a result as raw output . It is made of at least 2 types of files: The program itself One or several service interaction files or flavors A Python requirements file, which is only necessary if the analyzer is written in Python. The Program # The first type of files an analyzer is made of is the core program that performs actions. It can be written in any programming language that is supported by Linux. While many analyzers are written in Python ( *.py files), you can write yours in Ruby, Perl or even Scala. However, the very handy Cortexutils library described below is in Python. It greatly facilitates analyzer development and it also provides some methods to quickly format the output to make it compliant with the JSON schema expected by TheHive . Service Interaction Files (Flavors) # An analyzer must have at least one service interaction file. Such files contain key configuration information such as the analyzer's author information, the datatypes (IP, URL, hash, domain...) the analyzer accepts as input, the TLP and PAP ( Permissible Actions Protocol ) above which it will refuse to execute to protect against data leakage and to enforce sane OPSEC practices and so on. An analyzer can have two or more service interaction files to allow it to perform different actions. We speak then of flavors. For example, a sandbox analyzer can analyze a file with or without an Internet connection. Another example could be an analyzer that can either send a file to VirusTotal for analysis or get the last report using its hash. Python Requirements # If the analyzer is written in Python, a requirements.txt must be provided with the list of all the dependencies. Example: VirusTotal Analyzer Files # Below is a directory listing of the files corresponding to the VirusTotal analyzer. You can see that the analyzer has two flavors: GetReport and Scan . analyzers/VirusTotal | -- VirusTotal_GetReport.json | -- VirusTotal_Scan.json | -- requirements.txt | -- virustotal.py ` -- virustotal_api.py Input # The input of an analyzer is a JSON structure with different pieces of information. For example, to use the VirusTotal analyzer's GetReport flavor in order to obtain the latest available report for hash d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e , you must submit input such as: { \"data\" : \"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\" , \"dataType\" : \"hash\" , \"tlp\" : 0 , \"config\" :{ \"key\" : \"1234567890abcdef\" , \"max_tlp\" : 3 , \"check_tlp\" : true , \"service\" : \"GetReport\" [ .. ] }, \"proxy\" :{ \"http\" : \"http://myproxy:8080\" , \"https\" : \"https://myproxy:8080\" } } data , dataType and tlp are the observable-related information generated by TheHive or any other program that is calling Cortex. config is the analyzer's specific configuration provided by an orgAdmin users when the analyzer is enabled in the Cortex UI. Let's take the GetReport flavor of the VirusTotal analyzer as an example again. Example: VirusTotal Get Report's Input # { \"data\" : \"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\" , \"dataType\" : \"hash\" , \"tlp\" : 0 , [ .. ] } Example: Service Interaction File for VirusTotal GetReport # The <== sign and anything after it are comments that do no appear in the original file. { \"name\" : \"VirusTotal_GetReport\" , \"version\" : \"3.0\" , \"author\" : \"CERT-BDF\" , \"url\" : \"https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-Analyzers\" , \"license\" : \"AGPL-V3\" , \"description\" : \"Get the latest VirusTotal report for a file, hash, domain or an IP address.\" , \"dataTypeList\" : [ \"file\" , \"hash\" , \"domain\" , \"ip\" ], \"command\" : \"VirusTotal/virustotal.py\" , <== Program t o ru n whe n i n voki n g t he a nal yzer \"baseConfig\" : \"VirusTotal\" , <== na me o f base co nf ig i n Cor te x a nal yzer co nf ig page \"config\" : { \"service\" : \"get\" }, \"configurationItems\" : [ <== lis t o f co nf igura t io n i te ms t he a nal yzer nee ds t o opera te (api key e t c.) { \"name\" : \"key\" , \"description\" : \"API key for Virustotal\" , \"type\" : \"string\" , <== de f i nes wha t ki n d o f da ta t ype t he co nf igura t io n i te m is (s tr i n g , nu mber) \"multi\" : false , <== se tt i n g mul t i t o true allows t o pass a lis t o f i te ms (e.g. MISP a nal yzer) \"required\" : true }, { \"name\" : \"polling_interval\" , \"description\" : \"Define time interval between two requests attempts for the report\" , \"type\" : \"number\" , \"multi\" : false , \"required\" : false , \"defaultValue\" : 60 } ] } Service Interaction Configuration Items # name # Name of the specific service (or flavor) of the analyzer.

You must increase minor version numbers when bugs are fixed. The version number is also used in the folder name of the associated report templates ; e.g. VirusTotal_GetReport and 3.0 on the JSON file should correspond a folder named VirusTotal_GetReport_3_0 for report templates.

For example, the VirusTotal analyzer uses VT as a namespace and Score as a predicate. level intends to convey the maliciousness of the result: : info : the analyzer produced an information, and the short report is shown in blue color in TheHive. safe : the analyzer did not find anything suspicious or the analyzed observable is safe according to the analyzer. TheHive displays the short report in green color. suspicious : the analyzer found that the observable is either suspicious or warrants further investigation. The short report has an orange color in TheHive. malicious : the analyzer found that the observable is malicious. The short report is red colored in TheHive. For more information refer to our blog .

Feel free to start reading the code of some of them before writing your own. Report Templates # When using TheHive, analysts can submit an observable for analysis to one or several Cortex instances by a click of a button. Once finished, Cortex returns the result to TheHive. The TheHive displays that result using HTML templates for short and long reports. Cortex Result in TheHive # TheHive receives the Cortex result which is simply the JSON formatted analyzer output described above: The summary section is read to display short reports in the observables list and in the detailed observable page. This is stored in a dict object named content within TheHive. The full section is read to display long reports when clicking the short report in the observable list or when accessing a detailed observable page.

When Templates are Imported # If templates are imported into TheHive: Short reports are displayed in the observable list and in the detailed observable page.

Writing Templates # To display results nicely in TheHive, write two HTML templates: One for short reports One for long reports When TheHive users import them in the application, they will be definitely more efficient at reading the analyzer reports and do their job accordingly. If the analyzer is made of different flavors (i.e. has different service interaction files with a json extension), you should provide two HTML templates (short and long reports) for each flavor. For example, the VirusTotal analyzer comes in two flavors hence it has 4 HTML templates: thehive-templates/VirusTotal_GetReport_3_0 | -- long.html ` -- short.html thehive-templates/VirusTotal_Scan_3_0 | -- long.html ` -- short.html The folder's name is the concatenation of the name and the version values found in the service interaction files. TheHive uses Bootstrap and AngularJS so you can leverage them in your templates. Short Report Templates (short.html) # The short report uses taxonomies and is built into the analyzers by the summary() function. Report templates read it as shown in the example below: < span class = \"label\" ng-repeat = \"t in content.taxonomies\" ng-class = \"{'info': 'label-info', 'safe': 'label-success', 'suspicious': 'label-warning', 'malicious':'label-danger'}[t.level]\" > {{t.namespace}}:{{t.predicate}}={{t.value}} </ span > If you want to change or add the information displayed in the short report in the detailed observable page, you have to update the summary() function in the analyzer's program and edit short.html as well. Basically, copy the code in your short.html template and it will do the job. Long Report Templates (long.html) # Long report templates are more or less free form as long as it reads the content of the relevant section in the Cortex result ( full ). Feel free to check what has already been written for existing analyzers to write yours. A good start can be: <!-- Success --> < div class = \"panel panel-danger\" ng-if = \"success\" > < div class = \"panel-heading\" > ANALYZERNAME Report </ div > < div class = \"panel-body\" > [...] < = code here </ div > </ div > <!-- General error --> < div class = \"panel panel-danger\" ng-if = \"!success\" > < div class = \"panel-heading\" > < strong > {{(artifact.data || artifact.attachment.name) | fang}} </ strong > </ div > < div class = \"panel-body\" > < dl class = \"dl-horizontal\" ng-if = \"content.errorMessage\" > < dt >< i class = \"fa fa-warning\" ></ i > ANALYZERNAME: </ dt > < dd class = \"wrap\" > {{content.errorMessage}} </ dd > </ dl > </ div > </ div > Submitting an Analyzer # We highly encourage you to share your analyzers with the community through our Github repository.

Open an Issue # If there's no issue open for the analyzer you'd like to contribute, open one . Indicate that you are working on it to avoid having someone start coding it. You have to create an issue for each analyzer you'd like to submit. Review your Service Interaction File(s) # Review your service interaction files. For example, let's check the VirusTotal JSON analyzer configuration file(s): { \"name\" : \"VirusTotal_GetReport\" , \"version\" : \"3.0\" , \"author\" : \"CERT-BDF\" , \"url\" : \"https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-Analyzers\" , \"license\" : \"AGPL-V3\" , \"description\" : \"Get the latest VirusTotal report for a file, hash, domain or an IP address\" , \"dataTypeList\" : [ \"file\" , \"hash\" , \"domain\" , \"ip\" ], \"baseConfig\" : \"VirusTotal\" , \"config\" : { \"check_tlp\" : true , \"max_tlp\" : 3 , \"service\" : \"get\" }, \"command\" : \"VirusTotal/virustotal.py\" } Ensure that all information is correct and particularly the author and license parameters. Provide the List of Requirements # If your analyzer is written in Python, make sure to complete the requirements.txt file with the list of all the external libraries that are needed to run the analyzer correctly. Check the Taxonomy # We chose to use a formatted summary report to match a taxonomy as described above. If you want your analyzer reports in the observable lists, ensure that your summary matches this format. If your analyzer is written in Python and you are using our cortexutils library, you can use the summary() and build_taxonomy() functions. Provide Global Configuration Parameters # When submitting your analyzer, please provide the necessary global configuration in /etc/cortex/application.conf if needed. You can provide this information in a README file. Verify Execution # Use these three simple checks before submtting your analyzer: Ensure it works with the expected configuration, TLP or dataType.

Please note that API keys can only be used to interact with the Cortex API (for example when TheHive is interfaced with a Cortex instance, it must use an API key to authenticate to it). API keys cannot be used to authenticate to the Web UI. By default, Cortex relies on local credentials stored in Elasticsearch. Authentication methods are stored in the auth.provider parameter, which is multi-valued. When a user logs in, each authentication method is tried in order until one succeeds.

TheHive supports different methods to store data, files, and indexes according to your needs. However, even for a standalone, production server, we strongly recommend using Apache Cassandra as a scalable and fault-tolerant database. Files and indexes storage can vary, depending on your target setup ; for standalone server, the local filesystem is suitable, while sereval options are possible in the case of a cluster configuration. Installation and configuration guides # This documentation contains step-by-step installation instructions for TheHive for different operating systems as well as corresponding binary archives. All aspects of the configuration are aslo detailled in a dedicated section. User guides # TheHive supports differents roles for users.

TheHive supports different methods to store data, files, and indexes according to your needs. However, even for a standalone, production server, we strongly recommend using Apache Cassandra as a scalable and fault-tolerant database.

Before starting installing and configuring, you need to identify and define the targetted architecture. Choose a setup # The modular architecture makes it support several types of database, file storage system and indexing system. The initial choices made with the target architecture and the setup are crucial, especially for the database. If high availability and fault tolerance are necessary, implementing a cluster might be the choice, and this choice determines the database, the file storage and indexing system to install. Hardware Pre-requisites Hardware requirements depends on the number of concurrent users and how they use the system. The following table give some information to choose the hardware. Number of users CPU RAM < 3 2 4-8 < 10 4 8-16 < 20 8 16-32 Choose a database # Once the target setup is identified, the first choice to make is the database. Even of local Berkeley DB and Cassandra database are supported, we recommend using Apache Cassandra , which is a scalable and high available Database, even for standalone servers. Berkeley DB can be enough for testing purposes. Upgradability This choice is decisive as migration from Berkeley DB to Cassandra is not possible . Choose a file storage system # Like for databases, several options exist regarding file system. Basically, for standalone setups, using the local filesystem is the easiest solution. If installing a cluster, there are several options: Using a share NFS folder Using Apache Hadoop , a distributed file system Using a S3-compatible storage service ; for example with Min.IO Upgradability Starting with a standalone server and a local file storage and upgrading to a cluster with S3 of Hadoop is possible. Existing files can be moved to the targetted solutions. Choose an index system # Introduced with TheHive 4.1 to increase performances, TheHive relies on a dedicated indexing process. With a standalone setup, using a local index with Lucene is sufficient. In the case of a cluster, all nodes have to connect to the same index: an instance of Elasticsearch is then required. Upgradability Starting with a standalone server and Lucene and upgrading to a cluster with Elasticsearch is possible. Indices can be rebuilt. However, it can takes some time. Installation Guide # The following Guide let you prepare , install and configure TheHive and its prerequisites for Debian and RPM packages based Operating Systems, as well as for other systems and using our binary packages. If you want to build TheHive from sources, you can follow this guide . Configuration Guides # The configuration of TheHive is in files stored in the /etc/thehive folder: application.conf contains all parameters and options logback.xml is dedicated to log management /etc/thehive \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.conf \u251c\u2500\u2500 logback.xml \u2514\u2500\u2500 secret.conf A separate secret.conf file is automatically created by Debian or RPM packages. This file should contain a secret that should be used by one instance. Various aspects can configured in the application.conf file: database and indexing File storage Akka Authentication Connectors Cortex: connecting to one or more organisation MISP: connecting to one or more organisation Webhooks Other service parameters Uses Cases # Basic stand alone server # Follow the installation guides for you prefered operating system.

These indexes should be unique and the same for all nodes of TheHive cluster. TheHive embed a Lucene engine you can use for standalone server For clusters setups, an instance of Elasticsearch is required Local lucene engine Elasticsearch Create a folder dedicated to host indexes for TheHive: mkdir /opt/thp/thehive/index chown thehive:thehive -R /opt/thp/thehive/index Use an existing Elasticsearch instance or install a new one. This instance should be reachable by all nodes of a cluster. Warning Elasticsearch configuration should use the default value for script.allowed_types , or contain the following configuration line: script.allowed_types : inline,stored Note Indexes will be created at the first start of TheHive. It can take a certain amount of time, depending the size of the database Like data and files, indexes should be part of the backup policy Indexes can removed and created again File storage # Files uploaded in TheHive (in task logs or in observables ) can be stores in localsystem, in a Hadoop filesystem (recommended) or in the graph database. For standalone production and test servers , we recommends using local filesystem. If you think about building a cluster with TheHive, you have several possible solutions: using Hadoop or S3 services ; see the related guide for more details and an example with MinIO servers. Local Filesystem S3 with Min.io HDFS with Hadoop Warning This option is perfect for standalone servers . If you intend to build a cluster for your instance of TheHive 4 we recommend: using a NFS share, common to all nodes having a look at storage solutions implementing S3 or HDFS. To store files on the local filesystem, start by choosing the dedicated folder: mkdir -p /opt/thp/thehive/files This path will be used in the configuration of TheHive. Later, after having installed TheHive, ensure the user thehive owns the path chosen for storing files: chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp/thehive/files An example of installing, configuring and use Min.IO is detailed in this documentation . An example of installing, configuring and use Apache Hadoop is detailed in this documentation . TheHive # This part contains instructions to install TheHive and then configure it. Warning TheHive4 can't be installed on the same server than older versions. We recommend installing it on a new server, especially if a migration is foreseen.

This version introduce breaking changes. This time, we had no choice, we were not able to make TheHive support smoothly the ES upgrade. TheHive 3.5.0 supports Elasticsearch 7.x ONLY . This first steps before starting the upgrade process are: Identify the version of Elasticsearch which created your index Stop TheHive service Stop Elasticsearch service How to identify the version of Elasticsearch which created your database index ? # The software jq is required to manipulate JSON and create new indexes. More information at https://stedolan.github.io/jq/ . Run the following command : curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9200/the_hive_15?human | jq '.the_hive_15.settings.index.version.created_string' if the output is similar to \"5.x\" then your database index has been created with Elasticsearch 5.x reindexing is required, you should follow a dedicated process to upgrade . If it is \"6.x\" then your database has been created with Elasticsearch 6. Your database was created with Elasticsearch 5.x or earlier # This is where things might be complicated. This upgrade progress requires handling the database index by updating parameters, and reindex before updating Elasticsearch, and updating TheHive. Read carefully the dedicated documentation . It should help you run this specific actions on your Elasticsearch database, and also install or update application whether you are using DEB, RPM or binary packages, and even docker images. Your database was created with Elasticsearch 6.x # If you started using TheHive with Elasticsearch 6.x, then you just need to update the configuration of Elasticsearch to reflect this one: [..] http.host: 127.0.0.1 discovery.type: single-node cluster.name: hive script.allowed_types: inline thread_pool.search.queue_size: 100000 thread_pool.write.queue_size: 10000 Following parameters * are not accepted anymore by Elasticsearch 7: thread_pool.index.queue_size thread_pool.bulk.queue_size With TheHive service stopped, ensure the new version of Elasticsearch starts. If everything is ok, then TheHive 3.5.0 can be installed. To run this operation successfully, you need to update your repository configuration if you are using DEB and RPM packages, or specify the right version to install if using docker. Read carefully the installation guide . From 3.3.x to 3.4.0 # Starting from version 3.4.0-RC1, TheHive supports Elasticsearch 6 and will continue to work with Elasticsearch 5.x. TheHive 3.4.0-RC1 and later versions communicate with Elasticsearch using its HTTP service (9200/tcp by default) instead of its legacy binary protocol (9300/tcp by default). If you have a firewall between TheHive and Elasticsearch, you probably need to update its rules to change to the new port number. The configuration file ( application.conf ) needs some modifications to reflect the protocol change: The setting search.host is replaced by search.uri The general format of the URI is: http(s)://host:port,host:port(/prefix)?querystring . Multiple host:port combinations can be specified, separated by commas. Options can be specified using a standard URI query string syntax, eg. cluster.name=hive . The search.cluster setting is no longer used. Authentication can be configured with the search.user and search.password settings. When SSL/TLS is enabled, you can set a truststore and a keystore. The truststore contains the certificate authorities used to validate remote certificates. The keystore contains the certificate and the private key used to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster. The configuration is: search { keyStore { path: \"/path/to/keystore/file\" type: \"JKS\" # or PKCS12 password: \"secret.password.of.keystore\" } trustStore { path: \"/path/to/truststore/file\" type: \"JKS\" password: \"secret.password.of.truststore\" } } The Elasticsearch client also accepts the following settings: - circularRedirectsAllowed ( true / false ) - connectionRequestTimeout (number of seconds) - connectTimeout - contentCompressionEnabled.foreach(requestConfigBuilder.setContentCompressionEnabled) - search.cookieSpec (??) - expectContinueEnabled ( true / false ) - maxRedirects (number) - proxy -- not yet supported - proxyPreferredAuthSchemes -- not yet supported - redirectsEnabled ( true / false ) - relativeRedirectsAllowed ( true / false ) - socketTimeout (number of seconds) - targetPreferredAuthSchemes (??) The configuration items keepalive , pageSize , nbshards and nbreplicas are still valid. For practical details, you can have a look here for an example of migration of TheHive and Elasticsearch. From 3.0.x to 3.0.4 # TheHive 3.0.4 (Cerana 0.4) comes with new MISP settings to filter events that will be imported as alerts. Please refer to MISP event filters configuration section. The maximum number of custom fields and metrics in a case is 50 by default. If you try to put more, ElasticSearch will raise an error. You can now increase the limit by adding in your application.conf: index { settings { # Maximum number of nested fields mapping.nested_fields.limit = 100 } } The data schema has been changed in Cerana to support some dashboard features. At the first connection, TheHive will ask you to migrate the data. A new index, called the_hive_13 by default, will be created then. See Updating . From 2.13.x to 3.0.0 # The schema of data has been changed in Cerana to integrate dashboard. At the first request, TheHive will ask you to migrate the data. A new index, called the_hive_12 by default, will be created then. See Updating . From 2.13.0 or 2.13.1 to 2.13.2 # At the first connection to TheHive 2.13.2, a migration of the database will be asked. This will create a new ElasticSearch index ( the_hive_11 by default). See Updating . From 2.12.x to 2.13.x # Configuration updates # play.crypto.secret is deprecated, use play.http.secret.key instead. auth.type is deprecated, use auth.provider instead. Basic authentication is disabled by default. We strongly recommand to update the clients that rely on the API to interact with TheHive to use the new API key authentication method . This feature has been added in this release. If you need to enable basic authentication, use auth.method.basic=true in application.conf Note that the TheHive4Py 1.3.0 Python library also adds API key authentication support. Alert role # A new role \"alert\" has been added. Only users with this role can create an alert. If you have tool that uses TheHive API to create alerts, you must give the ability to do it in user administration. ElasticSearch # TheHive 2.13 uses ElasticSearch 5.x. Our tests have been done on ElasticSearch 5.5. So we recommend to use this specific version, even if TheHive should work perfectly with ElasticSearch 5.6 that doesn't introduce breaking changes. Data structure migration # Before upgrading ElasticSearch, backup all your indices . Then remove all indices except the last index of TheHive (most probably the_hive_10). You can list all indices with the following command: curl http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/indices ElasticSearch has changed the structure of its data directory (please refer to Path to data on disk ). The node name in the path where data are stored (DATA_DIR) must be removed. Stop ElasticSearch and execute the following lines to change the directory structure: echo -n 'Enter the path of ElasticSearch data: ' read DATA_DIR echo -n 'Enter the name of your cluster [hive]: ' read CLUSTER_NAME mv ${DATA_DIR}/${CLUSTER_NAME:=hive}/* ${DATA_DIR} rmdir ${DATA_DIR}/${CLUSTER_NAME} System requirements # ElasticSearch 5.x requires at least 262144 memory map areas (vm.max_map_count). Run sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144. To make this setting persistent after a server restart, add vm.max_map_count = 262144 in /etc/sysctl.conf (or to /etc/sysctl.d/80-elasticsearch.conf ) Configuration # The configuration of ElasticSearch should contain the following settings: http.host: 127.0.0.1 transport.host: 127.0.0.1 cluster.name: hive script.inline: true thread_pool.index.queue_size: 100000 thread_pool.search.queue_size: 100000 thread_pool.bulk.queue_size: 100000 Adapt http.host and transport.host to your environment. Docker # The default ElasticSearch image has been deprecated. It is recommended to use the docker image from Elastic.co . The new image doesn't use the same user ID so you need to change the owner of the data files. You can simply run chown -R 1000.1000 $DATA_DIR (DATA_DIR is the folder which contains ElasticSearch data). Then you can use the following script: docker run \\ --name elasticsearch \\ --hostname elasticsearch \\ --rm \\ --publish 127.0.0.1:9200:9200 \\ --publish 127.0.0.1:9300:9300 \\ --volume ***DATA_DIR***:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data \\ -e \"http.host=0.0.0.0\" \\ -e \"transport.host=0.0.0.0\" \\ -e \"xpack.security.enabled=false\" \\ -e \"cluster.name=hive\" \\ -e \"script.inline=true\" \\ -e \"thread_pool.index.queue_size=100000\" \\ -e \"thread_pool.search.queue_size=100000\" \\ -e \"thread_pool.bulk.queue_size=100000\" \\ docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.5.2 Note : TheHive doesn't support X-Pack.

This is necessary for TheHive to retrieve their role and authenticate them against the local database, LDAP and/or AD directories. There are 4 roles currently: - read : all non-sensitive data can be read. With this role, a user can't make any change. They can't add a case, task, log or observable. They also can't run analyzers; - write : create, remove and change data of any type. This role is for standard users. write role inherits read rights; - admin : this role is reserved for TheHive administrators. Users with this role can manage user accounts, metrics, create case templates and observable data types. admin inherits write rights; - alert : users with this role can only create alerts. Warning : Please note that user accounts cannot be removed once they have been created, otherwise audit logs will refer to an unknown user. However, unwanted or unused accounts can be locked. 2. Case template management # Some cases may share the same structure (tags, tasks, description, metrics). Templates are here to automatically add tasks, description, metrics and custom fields while creating a new case. A user can choose to create an empty case or based on a registered template. To create a template, as admin go into the administration menu, and open the \"Case templates\" item. In this screen, you can add, remove or change template. A template contains: * default severity * default tags * title prefix (can be changed by user at case creation) * default TLP * default default * task list (title and description) * metrics * custom fields Except for title prefix, task list and metrics, the user can change values defined in template. 3. Report template management # When TheHive is connected to a Cortex server, observables can be analyzed to get additional information on them. Cortex outputs reports in JSON format. In order to make reports more readable, you can configure report templates. Report templates convert JSON in to HTML using the AngularJS template engine. For each analyzer available in Cortex you can define two kinds of templates: short and long. A short report exposes synthetic information, shows in top of observable page. With short reports you can see a summary of all run analyzers. Long reports show detailed information only when the user selects the report. Raw data in JSON format is always available. Report templates can be configured in the Admin > Report templates menu. We offer report templates for default Cortex analyzers. A package with all report templates can be downloaded at https://download.thehive-project.org/report-templates.zip and can be injected using the Import templates button. 4. Metrics management # Metrics have been integrated to have relevant indicators about cases. Metrics are numerical values associated to cases (for example, the number of impacted users). Each metric has a name , a title and a description , defined by an administrator. When a metric is added to a case, it can't be removed and must be filled. Metrics are used to monitor business indicators, thanks to graphs. Metrics are defined globally. To create metrics, as admin go into the administration menu, and open the \"Case metrics\" item. Metrics are used to create statistics (\"Statistics\" item in the user profile menu). They can be filtered on time interval, and case with specific tags. For example you can show metrics of case with \"malspam\" tag on January 2016 : For graphs based on time, the user can choose metrics to show. They are aggregated on interval of time (by day, week, month of year) using a function (sum, min or max). Some metrics are predefined (in addition to those defined by administrator) like case handling duration (how much time the case had been open) and number of cases open or closed.","title":"Administrator's guide"},{"location":"thehive/legacy/thehive3/admin/admin-guide/#administrators-guide","text":"","title":"Administrator's guide"},{"location":"thehive/legacy/thehive3/admin/admin-guide/#1-user-management","text":"Users can be managed through the Administration > Users page.

Three settings are required to connect to Elasticsearch: * the base name of the index * the name of the cluster * the address(es) and port(s) of the Elasticsearch instance The Defaults settings are: # Elasticsearch search { ## Basic configuration # Index name. index = the_hive # ElasticSearch instance address. uri = \"http://127.0.0.1:9200/\" # Scroll keepalive keepalive = 1m # Size of the page for scroll pagesize = 50 # Number of shards nbshards = 5 # Number of replicas nbreplicas = 1 # Arbitrary settings settings { # Maximum number of nested fields mapping.nested_fields.limit = 100 } ## Authentication configuration #search.username = \"\" #search.password = \"\" ## SSL configuration #search.keyStore { # path = \"/path/to/keystore\" # type = \"JKS\" # or PKCS12 # password = \"keystore-password\" #} #search.trustStore { # path = \"/path/to/trustStore\" # type = \"JKS\" # or PKCS12 # password = \"trustStore-password\" #} } If you use a different configuration, modify the parameters accordingly in the application.conf file. If multiple Elasticsearch nodes are used as a cluster, you should add addresses of the master nodes in the url like this: search { uri = http://node1:9200,node2:9200/ ... TheHive uses the http port of Elasticsearch (9200/tcp by default). TheHive versions index schema (mapping) in Elasticsearch. Version numbers are appended to the index base name (the 8th version of the schema uses the index the_hive_8 if search.index = the_hive ). When too many documents are requested to TheHive, it uses the scroll feature: the results are retrieved through pagination. You can specify the size of the page ( search.pagesize ) and how long pages are kept in Elasticsearch (( search.keepalive ) before purging. 2. Datastore # TheHive stores attachments as Elasticsearch documents. They are split in chunks and each chunk sent to Elasticsearch is identified by the hash of the entire attachment and the associated chunk number. The chunk size ( datastore.chunksize ) can be changed but any change will only affect new attachments. Existing ones won't be changed. An attachment is identified by its hash. The algorithm used is configurable ( datastore.hash.main ) but must not be changed after the first attachment insertion. Otherwise, previous files cannot be retrieved. Extra hash algorithms can be configured using datastore.hash.extra . These hashes are not used to identify the attachment but are shown in the user interface (the hash associated to the main algorithm is also shown). If you change extra algorithms, you should inform TheHive and ask it to recompute all hashes. Please note that the associated API call is currently disabled in Buckfast (v 2.10). It will be reinstated in the next release. Observables can contain malicious data. When you try to download an attachment from an observable (typically a file), it is automatically zipped and the resulting ZIP file is password-protected. The default password is malware but it can be changed with the datastore.attachment.password setting. Default values are: # Datastore datastore { name = data # Size of stored data chunks chunksize = 50k hash { # Main hash algorithm /!\\ Don't change this value main = \"SHA-256\" # Additional hash algorithms (used in attachments) extra = [\"SHA-1\", \"MD5\"] } attachment.password = \"malware\" } 3. Authentication # TheHive supports local, LDAP, Active Directory (AD) or OAuth2/OpenID Connect for authentication. By default, it relies on local credentials stored in Elasticsearch. Authentication methods are stored in the auth.provider parameter, which is multi-valued. When a user logs in, each authentication method is tried in order until one succeeds. If no authentication method works, an error is returned and the user cannot log in. The default values within the configuration file are: auth { # \"provider\" parameter contains authentication provider. It can be multi-valued (useful for migration) # available auth types are: # services.LocalAuthSrv : passwords are stored in user entity (in Elasticsearch). No configuration is required. # ad : use ActiveDirectory to authenticate users. Configuration is under \"auth.ad\" key # ldap : use LDAP to authenticate users. Configuration is under \"auth.ldap\" key # oauth2 : use OAuth/OIDC to authenticate users. Configuration is under \"auth.oauth2\" and \"auth.sso\" keys provider = [local] # By default, basic authentication is disabled. You can enable it by setting \"method.basic\" to true. #method.basic = true ad { # The Windows domain name in DNS format. This parameter is required if you do not use # 'serverNames' below. #domainFQDN = \"mydomain.local\" # Optionally you can specify the host names of the domain controllers instead of using 'domainFQDN # above. If this parameter is not set, TheHive uses 'domainFQDN'. #serverNames = [ad1.mydomain.local, ad2.mydomain.local] # The Windows domain name using short format. This parameter is required. #domainName = \"MYDOMAIN\" # If 'true', use SSL to connect to the domain controller. #useSSL = true } ldap { # The LDAP server name or address. The port can be specified using the 'host:port' # syntax. This parameter is required if you don't use 'serverNames' below. #serverName = \"ldap.mydomain.local:389\" # If you have multiple LDAP servers, use the multi-valued setting 'serverNames' instead. #serverNames = [ldap1.mydomain.local, ldap2.mydomain.local] # Account to use to bind to the LDAP server. This parameter is required. #bindDN = \"cn=thehive,ou=services,dc=mydomain,dc=local\" # Password of the binding account. This parameter is required. #bindPW = \"***secret*password***\" # Base DN to search users. This parameter is required. #baseDN = \"ou=users,dc=mydomain,dc=local\" # Filter to search user in the directory server. Please note that {0} is replaced # by the actual user name. This parameter is required. #filter = \"(cn={0})\" # If 'true', use SSL to connect to the LDAP directory server. #useSSL = true } oauth2 { # URL of the authorization server #clientId = \"client-id\" #clientSecret = \"client-secret\" #redirectUri = \"https://my-thehive-instance.example/api/ssoLogin\" #responseType = \"code\" #grantType = \"authorization_code\" # URL from where to get the access token #authorizationUrl = \"https://auth-site.com/OAuth/Authorize\" #tokenUrl = \"https://auth-site.com/OAuth/Token\" # The endpoint from which to obtain user details using the OAuth token, after successful login #userUrl = \"https://auth-site.com/api/User\" #scope = [\"openid profile\"] } # Single-Sign On sso { # Autocreate user in database? #autocreate = false # Autoupdate its profile and roles? #autoupdate = false # Autologin user using SSO? #autologin = false # Attributes mappings #attributes { # login = \"sub\" # name = \"name\" # groups = \"groups\" # #roles = \"roles\" #} # Name of mapping class from user resource to backend user ('simple' or 'group') #mapper = group # Default roles for users with no groups mapped (\"read\", \"write\", \"admin\") #defaultRoles = [] #groups { # # URL to retrieve groups (leave empty if you are using OIDC) # #url = \"https://auth-site.com/api/Groups\" # # Group mappings, you can have multiple roles for each group: they are merged # mappings { # admin-profile-name = [\"admin\"] # editor-profile-name = [\"write\"] # reader-profile-name = [\"read\"] # } #} } } # Maximum time between two requests without requesting authentication session { warning = 5m inactivity = 1h } 3.1. LDAP/AD # To enable authentication using AD or LDAP, edit the application.conf file and supply the values for your environment. Then you need to create an account on TheHive for each AD or LDAP user in Administration > Users page (which can only be accessed by an administrator). This is required as TheHive needs to look up the role associated with the user and that role is stored locally by TheHive. Obviously, you don't need to supply a password as TheHive will check the credentials against the remote directory. In order to use SSL on LDAP or AD, TheHive must be able to validate remote certificates. To that end, the Java truststore must contain certificate authorities used to generate the AD and/or LDAP certificates. The Default JVM truststore contains the main official authorities but LDAP and AD certificates are probably not issued by them. Use keytool to create the truststore: keytool -import -file /path/to/your/ca.cert -alias InternalCA -keystore /path/to/your/truststore.jks Then add -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/your/truststore.jks parameter when you start TheHive or put it in the JAVA_OPTS environment variable before starting TheHive. 3.2. OAuth2/OpenID Connect # To enable authentication using OAuth2/OpenID Connect, edit the application.conf file and supply the values of auth.oauth2 according to your environment. In addition, you need to supply: auth.sso.attributes.login : name of the attribute containing the OAuth2 user's login in retreived user info (mandatory) auth.sso.attributes.name : name of the attribute containing the OAuth2 user's name in retreived user info (mandatory) auth.sso.attributes.groups : name of the attribute containing the OAuth2 user's groups (mandatory using groups mappings) auth.sso.attributes.roles : name of the attribute containing the OAuth2 user's roles in retreived user info (mandatory using simple mapping) Important notes # Authenticate the user using an external OAuth2 authenticator server. The configuration is: clientId (string) client ID in the OAuth2 server. clientSecret (string) client secret in the OAuth2 server. redirectUri (string) the url of TheHive AOuth2 page (.../api/ssoLogin). responseType (string) type of the response. Currently only \"code\" is accepted. grantType (string) type of the grant. Currently only \"authorization_code\" is accepted. authorizationUrl (string) the url of the OAuth2 server. authorizationHeader (string) prefix of the authorization header to get user info: Bearer, token, ... tokenUrl (string) the token url of the OAuth2 server. userUrl (string) the url to get user information in OAuth2 server. scope (list of string) list of scope. Example # auth { provider = [local, oauth2] [..] sso { autocreate: false autoupdate: false mapper: \"simple\" attributes { login: \"login\" name: \"name\" roles: \"role\" } defaultRoles: [\"read\", \"write\"] defaultOrganization: \"demo\" } oauth2 { name: oauth2 clientId: \"Client_ID\" clientSecret: \"Client_ID\" redirectUri: \"http://localhost:9000/api/ssoLogin\" responseType: code grantType: \"authorization_code\" authorizationUrl: \"https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize\" authorizationHeader: \"token\" tokenUrl: \"https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token\" userUrl: \"https://api.github.com/user\" scope: [\"user\"] } [..] } 3.2.1. Roles mappings # You can choose a roles mapping with the auth.sso.mapper parameter. The available options are simple and group : Using simple mapping, we assume that the user info retrieved from auth.oauth2.userUrl contains the roles associated to the OAuth2 user. They can be: read , write or admin . Using groups mappings, we assume the retrieved user info contains groups that have to be associated to internal roles. In that case, you have to define mapppings in auth.sso.groups.mappings . If a user has multiple groups, mapped roles are merged. If you need to retreive groups from another endpoint that the one used for user info, you can provide it in auth.sso.groups.url . The retrieved groups can be a valid JSON array or a string listing them: { \"sub\": \"userid1\", \"name\": \"User name 1\", \"groups\": [\"admin-profile-name\", \"reader-profile-name\"] } OR { \"sub\": \"userid2\", \"name\": \"User name 2\", \"groups\": \"[admin-profile-name, reader-profile-name, \\\"another profile\\\", 'a last group']\" } OR { \"sub\": \"userid3\", \"name\": \"User name 3\", \"groups\": \"the-only-group-of-the-user\" } Finally, you can setup default roles associated with user with no roles/groups retrieved, using the auth.sso.defaultRoles parameter. 3.2.2. User autocreation, autoupdate and autologin # The main advantage of OAuth2/OpenID Connect authentication is you won't need to create an account on TheHive for each OAuth2 user if you set the config parameter auth.sso.autocreate to true . However, by default, OAuth2 users won't be updated on SSO login unless you set auth.sso.autoupdate to true . If you set this last parameter, roles and name will be fetched from retrieved user info and will be updated in local database on each login of the user. With auth.sso.autologin set to true , each user connecting to TheHive will automatically be redirected to auth.oauth2.authorizationUrl . The only way to authenticate in TheHive using a local user will be either: Connecting to TheHive using https://my-hive-instance.com/index.html#!/login?code=BAD_CODE . You will get an Authentication Failure but will then be able to authenticate. Connecting to TheHive using a real OAuth2 account, then disconnect. On disconnection, you won't be redirected to authorization URL. 3.2.3. Debugging # To debug the OAuth2 feature, you can uncomment the following lines in /etc/thehive/logback.xml : <!-- Uncomment the next lines to log debug information for OAuth/OIDC login --> <logger name=\"org.elastic4play.services.auth\" level=\"DEBUG\" /> <logger name=\"services.OAuth2Srv\" level=\"DEBUG\" /> <logger name=\"services.mappers\" level=\"DEBUG\" /> 4. Streaming (a.k.a The Flow) # The user interface is automatically updated when data is changed in the back-end. To do this, the back-end sends events to all the connected front-ends. The mechanism used to notify the front-end is called long polling and its settings are: refresh : when there is no notification, close the connection after this duration (the default is 1 minute). cache : before polling a session must be created, in order to make sure no event is lost between two polls. If there is no poll during the cache setting, the session is destroyed (the default is 15 minutes). nextItemMaxWait , globalMaxWait : when an event occurs, it is not immediately sent to the front-ends. The back-end waits nextItemMaxWait and up to globalMaxWait in case another event can be included in the notification. This mechanism saves many HTTP requests. Default values are: # Streaming stream.longpolling { # Maximum time a stream request waits for new element refresh = 1m # Lifetime of the stream session without request cache = 15m nextItemMaxWait = 500ms globalMaxWait = 1s } 5. Entity size limit # The Play framework used by TheHive sets the HTTP body size limit to 100KB by default for textual content (json, xml, text, form data) and 10MB for file uploads. This could be too small in most cases so you may want to change it with the following settings in the application.conf file: # Max textual content length play.http.parser.maxMemoryBuffer=1M # Max file size play.http.parser.maxDiskBuffer=1G Note : if you are using a NGINX reverse proxy in front of TheHive, be aware that it doesn't distinguish between text data and a file upload. So, you should also set the client_max_body_size parameter in your NGINX server configuration to the highest value among the two: file upload and text size defined in TheHive application.conf file. 6. Cortex # TheHive can use one or several Cortex analysis engines to get additional information on observables. When configured, analyzers available in Cortex become usable on TheHive. First you must enable CortexConnector , choose an identifier then specify the URL for each Cortex server: ## Enable the Cortex module play.modules.enabled += connectors.cortex.CortexConnector cortex { \"CORTEX-SERVER-ID\" { # URL of the Cortex server url = \"http://CORTEX_SERVER:CORTEX_PORT\" # Key of the Cortex user, mandatory for Cortex 2 key = \"API key\" } # HTTP client configuration, more details in section 8 # ws { # proxy {} # ssl {} # } # Check job update time interval refreshDelay = 1 minute # Maximum number of successive errors before give up maxRetryOnError = 3 # Check remote Cortex status time interval statusCheckInterval = 1 minute } If you connect TheHive with Cortex 2, you must create a user in Cortex with the read, analyze roles, set an API key and add this key in the Cortex server definition in TheHive application.conf . For Cortex 1, authentication is not required, the key is not used. To create a user with the read, analyze role in Cortex 2, you must have at least one organization configured then you can connect to the Cortex 2 Web UI using a orgAdmin account for that organization to create the user and generate their API key. Please refer to the Cortex Quick Start Guide for more information. Cortex analyzes observables and outputs reports in JSON format. TheHive shows the report as-is by default. In order to make reports more readable, we provide report templates which are in a separate package and must be installed manually: - download the report template package from https://dl.bintray.com/thehive-project/binary/report-templates.zip - log in TheHive using an administrator account - go to Admin > Report templates menu - click on Import templates button and select the downloaded package HTTP client used by Cortex connector use global configuration (in play.ws ) but can be overridden in Cortex section and in each Cortex server configuration. Refer to section 8 for more detail on how to configure HTTP client. 7. MISP # TheHive has the ability to connect to one or several MISP instances in order to import and export events. Hence TheHive is able to: receive events as they are added or updated from multiple MISP instances. These events will appear within the Alerts pane. export cases as MISP events to one or several MISP instances. The exported cases will not be published automatically though as they need to be reviewed prior to publishing. We strongly advise you to review the categories and types of attributes at least, before publishing the corresponding MISP events. Note : Please note that only and all the observables marked as IOCs will be used to create the MISP event. Any other observable will not be shared. This is not configurable. Within the configuration file, you can register your MISP server(s) under the misp configuration keyword. Each server shall be identified using an arbitrary name, its url , the corresponding authentication key and optional tags to add each observable created from a MISP event. Any registered server will be used to import events as alerts. It can also be used to export cases to as MISP events, if the account used by TheHive on the MISP instance has sufficient rights. This means that TheHive can import events from configured MISP servers and export cases to the same configured MISP servers. Having different configuration for sources and destination servers is expected in a future version. Important Notes # TheHive requires MISP 2.4.73 or better . Make sure that your are using a compatible version of MISP before reporting problems. MISP 2.4.72 and below do not work correctly with TheHive. 7.1 Configuration # To sync with a MISP server and retrieve events or export cases, edit the application.conf file and adjust the example shown below to your setup: ## Enable the MISP module (import and export) play.modules.enabled += connectors.misp.MispConnector misp { \"MISP-SERVER-ID\" { # URL of the MISP instance. url = \"<The_URL_of_the_MISP_Server_goes_here>\" # Authentication key. key = \"<the_auth_key_goes_here>\" # Name of the case template created in TheHive that shall be used to import # MISP events as cases by default. caseTemplate = \"<Template_Name_goes_here>\" # Tags to add to each observable imported from an event available on # this instance. tags = [\"misp-server-id\"] # Truststore to use to validate the X.509 certificate of the MISP # instance if the default truststore is not sufficient. #ws.ssl.trustManager.stores = [ #{ # type: \"JKS\" # path: \"/path/to/truststore.jks\" #} #] # HTTP client configuration, more details in section 8 # ws { # proxy {} # ssl {} # } # filters: max-attributes = 1000 max-size = 1 MiB max-age = 7 days exclusion { organisation = [\"bad organisation\", \"other orga\"] tags = [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"] } whitelist.tags = [\"whitelist-tag1\", \"whitelist-tag2\"] # MISP purpose defines if this instance can be used to import events (ImportOnly), export cases (ExportOnly) or both (ImportAndExport) # Default is ImportAndExport purpose = ImportAndExport } # Check remote TheHive status time interval statusCheckInterval = 1 minute # Interval between consecutive MISP event imports in hours (h) or # minutes (m). interval = 1h } The HTTP client used by the MISP connector uses a global configuration (in play.ws ) but it can be overridden within the MISP section of the configuation file and/or in the configuration section of each MISP server (in misp.MISP-SERVER-ID.ws ). Refer to section 8 for more details on how to configure the HTTP client. 7.2 Associate a Case Template to Alerts corresponding to MISP events # As stated in the subsection above, TheHive is able to automatically import MISP events (they will appear as alerts within the Alerts pane) and create cases out of them. This operation leverages the template engine. Thus you'll need to create a case template prior to importing MISP events. First, create a case template. Let's call it MISP-EVENT . Then update TheHive's configuration to add a 'caseTemplate' parameter as shown in the example below: misp { \"MISP-SERVER-ID\" { # URL of the MISP server url = \"<The_URL_of_the_MISP_Server_goes_here>\" # authentication key key = \"<the_auth_key_goes_here>\" # tags that must be automatically added to the case corresponding to the imported event tags = [\"misp\"] # case template caseTemplate = \"MISP-EVENT\" } Once the configuration file has been edited, restart TheHive. Every new import of a MISP event will generate a case using to the MISP-EVENT template by default. The template can be overridden though during the event import. MISP events will only be imported by TheHive if they have at least one attribute and were published. 7.3 Event Filters # When you first connect TheHive to a MISP instance, you can be overwhelmed by the number of alerts that will be generated, particularly if the MISP instance contains a lot of events. Indeed, every event, even those that date back to the beginning of the Internet, will generate an alert. To avoid alert fatigue, and starting from TheHive 3.0.4 (Cerana 0.4), you can exclude MISP events using different filters: the maximum number of attributes (max-attributes) the maximum size of the event's JSON message (max-size) the maximum age of the last publication (max-age) the organisation is black-listed (exclusion.organisation) one of the tags is black-listed (exclusion.tags) doesn't contain one of the whitelist tag (whitelist.tags) Please note that MISP event filters can be adapted to the configuration associated to each MISP server TheHive is connected with. As regards the max-age filter, it applies to the publication date of MISP events and not to the creation date. In the example below, the following MISP events won't generate alerts in TheHive: events that have more than 1000 attributes events which JSON message size is greater than 1MB events that have been published more than one week from the current date events that have been created by bad organisation or other orga events that contain tag1 or tag2 # filters: max-attributes = 1000 max-size = 1 MiB max-age = 7 days exclusion { organisation = [\"bad organisation\", \"other orga\"] tags = [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"] } Of course, you can omit some of the filters or all of them. 7.4 MISP Purpose # TheHive can interact with MISP in two ways: import a MISP event to create a case in TheHive and export a TheHive case to create a MISP event. By default, any MISP instance that is added to TheHive's configuration will be used for importing events and exporting cases ( ImportAndExport ). If you want to use MISP in only one way, you can set its purpose in the configuration as ImportOnly or ExportOnly . Starting from TheHive 3.3, when exporting a case to a MISP instance, you can export all its tags to the freshly created MISP event. This behaviour is not enabled by default. If you want to enable it you must set the exportCaseTags variable to true as shown below: misp { \"local\" { url = \"http://127.0.0.1\" key = \"<the_auth_key_goes_here>\" exportCaseTags = true [...] # additional parameters go here } } 8. HTTP Client Configuration # HTTP client can be configured by adding ws key in sections that needs to connect to remote HTTP service. The key can contain configuration items defined in play WS configuration : ws.followRedirects : Configures the client to follow 301 and 302 redirects (default is true). ws.useragent : To configure the User-Agent header field. ws.compressionEnabled : Set it to true to use gzip/deflater encoding (default is false). Timeouts # There are 3 different timeouts in WS. Reaching a timeout causes the WS request to interrupt. - ws.timeout.connection : The maximum time to wait when connecting to the remote host (default is 120 seconds). - ws.timeout.idle : The maximum time the request can stay idle (connection is established but waiting for more data) (default is 120 seconds). - ws.timeout.request : The total time you accept a request to take (it will be interrupted even if the remote host is still sending data) (default is 120 seconds). Proxy # Proxy can be used. By default, the proxy configured in JVM is used but one can configured specific configurations for each HTTP client. - ws.useProxyProperties : To use the JVM system\u2019s HTTP proxy settings (http.proxyHost, http.proxyPort) (default is true). This setting is ignored if ws.proxy settings is present. - ws.proxy.host : The hostname of the proxy server. - ws.proxy.post : The port of the proxy server. - ws.proxy.protocol : The protocol of the proxy server. Use \"http\" or \"https\". Defaults to \"http\" if not specified. - ws.proxy.user : The username of the credentials for the proxy server. - ws.proxy.password : The password for the credentials for the proxy server. - ws.proxy.ntlmDomain : The password for the credentials for the proxy server. - ws.proxy.encoding : The realm's charset. - ws.proxy.nonProxyHosts : The list of hosts on which proxy must not be used. SSL # SSL of HTTP client can be completely configured in application.conf file. Certificate manager # Certificate manager is used to store client certificates and certificate authorities. keyManager indicates which certificate HTTP client can use to authenticate itself on remote host (when certificate based authentication is used) ws.ssl.keyManager { stores = [ { type: \"pkcs12\" // JKS or PEM path: \"mycert.p12\" password: \"password1\" } ] } Certificate authorities are configured using trustManager key. It is used to establish a secure connection with remote host. Server certificate must be signed by a trusted certificate authority. ws.ssl.trustManager { stores = [ { type: \"JKS\" // JKS or PEM path: \"keystore.jks\" password: \"password1\" } ] } Debugging # To debug the key manager / trust manager, set the following flags: ws.ssl.debug = { ssl = true trustmanager = true keymanager = true sslctx = true handshake = true verbose = true data = true certpath = true } Protocols # If you want to define a different default protocol, you can set it specifically in the client: ws.ssl.protocol = \"TLSv1.2\" If you want to define the list of enabled protocols, you can do so explicitly: ws.ssl.enabledProtocols = [\"TLSv1.2\", \"TLSv1.1\", \"TLSv1\"] Ciphers # Cipher suites can be configured using ws.ssl.enabledCipherSuites : ws.ssl.enabledCipherSuites = [ \"TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\", \"TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\", \"TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\", \"TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\", ] 9. Monitoring and Performance Metrics (deprecated) # Performance metrics (response time, call rate to Elasticsearch and HTTP request, throughput, memory used...) can be collected if enabled in configuration. Enable it by editing the application.conf file, and add: # Register module for dependency injection play.modules.enabled += connectors.metrics.MetricsModule metrics.enabled = true These metrics can optionally be sent to an external database (graphite, ganglia or influxdb) in order to monitor the health of the platform.

HTTPS # You can enable HTTPS on TheHive application or add a reverse proxy in front of TheHive. The latter solution is recommended. 10.1 HTTPS using a reverse proxy # You can choose any reverse proxy to add SSL on TheHive. Below an example of NGINX configuration: server { listen 443 ssl; server_name thehive.example.com; ssl_certificate ssl/thehive_cert.pem; ssl_certificate_key ssl/thehive_key.pem; proxy_connect_timeout 600; proxy_send_timeout 600; proxy_read_timeout 600; send_timeout 600; client_max_body_size 2G; proxy_buffering off; client_header_buffer_size 8k; location / { add_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\"; proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000/; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Connection \"\"; # cf. https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/19542 } } 10.2 HTTPS without reverse proxy # This is not supported. 10.3 Strengthen security # When SSL is enable (with reverse proxy or not), you can configure cookie to be \"secure\" (usable only with HTTPS protocol). This is done by adding play.http.session.secure=true in the application.conf file. You can also enable HSTS . This header must be configured on the SSL termination component.

Three settings are required to connect to Elasticsearch: * the base name of the index * the name of the cluster * the address(es) and port(s) of the Elasticsearch instance The Defaults settings are: # Elasticsearch search { ## Basic configuration # Index name. index = the_hive # ElasticSearch instance address. uri = \"http://127.0.0.1:9200/\" # Scroll keepalive keepalive = 1m # Size of the page for scroll pagesize = 50 # Number of shards nbshards = 5 # Number of replicas nbreplicas = 1 # Arbitrary settings settings { # Maximum number of nested fields mapping.nested_fields.limit = 100 } ## Authentication configuration #search.username = \"\" #search.password = \"\" ## SSL configuration #search.keyStore { # path = \"/path/to/keystore\" # type = \"JKS\" # or PKCS12 # password = \"keystore-password\" #} #search.trustStore { # path = \"/path/to/trustStore\" # type = \"JKS\" # or PKCS12 # password = \"trustStore-password\" #} } If you use a different configuration, modify the parameters accordingly in the application.conf file. If multiple Elasticsearch nodes are used as a cluster, you should add addresses of the master nodes in the url like this: search { uri = http://node1:9200,node2:9200/ ... TheHive uses the http port of Elasticsearch (9200/tcp by default). TheHive versions index schema (mapping) in Elasticsearch. Version numbers are appended to the index base name (the 8th version of the schema uses the index the_hive_8 if search.index = the_hive ). When too many documents are requested to TheHive, it uses the scroll feature: the results are retrieved through pagination. You can specify the size of the page ( search.pagesize ) and how long pages are kept in Elasticsearch (( search.keepalive ) before purging.","title":"1. Database"},{"location":"thehive/legacy/thehive3/admin/configuration/#2-datastore","text":"TheHive stores attachments as Elasticsearch documents. They are split in chunks and each chunk sent to Elasticsearch is identified by the hash of the entire attachment and the associated chunk number. The chunk size ( datastore.chunksize ) can be changed but any change will only affect new attachments. Existing ones won't be changed. An attachment is identified by its hash. The algorithm used is configurable ( datastore.hash.main ) but must not be changed after the first attachment insertion. Otherwise, previous files cannot be retrieved. Extra hash algorithms can be configured using datastore.hash.extra . These hashes are not used to identify the attachment but are shown in the user interface (the hash associated to the main algorithm is also shown). If you change extra algorithms, you should inform TheHive and ask it to recompute all hashes. Please note that the associated API call is currently disabled in Buckfast (v 2.10). It will be reinstated in the next release. Observables can contain malicious data. When you try to download an attachment from an observable (typically a file), it is automatically zipped and the resulting ZIP file is password-protected. The default password is malware but it can be changed with the datastore.attachment.password setting.

TheHive requires Elasticsearch to run. You can use docker-compose to start them together in Docker or install and configure Elasticsearch manually. Use Docker-compose # Docker-compose can start multiple dockers and link them together. The following docker-compose.yml file starts Elasticsearch and TheHive: version: \"2\" services: elasticsearch: image: elasticsearch:7.9.1 environment: - http.host=0.0.0.0 - discovery.type=single-node ulimits: nofile: soft: 65536 hard: 65536 cortex: image: thehiveproject/cortex:3.1.0-1 depends_on: - elasticsearch ports: - \"0.0.0.0:9001:9001\" thehive: image: thehiveproject/thehive:3.5.0-1 depends_on: - elasticsearch - cortex ports: - \"0.0.0.0:9000:9000\" command: --cortex-port 9001 Put this file in an empty folder and run docker-compose up . TheHive is exposed on 9000/tcp port and Cortex on 9001/tcp. These ports can be changed by modifying the docker-compose file. You can specify a custom TheHive configuration file ( application.conf ) by adding the following lines in the thehive section of your docker-compose file: volumes: - /path/to/application.conf:/etc/thehive/application.conf To take effect, be sure that: - '/path/to/application.conf' is readable for the user who runs the docker daemon (typically 644) - you specified command: --no-config in your docker-compose.yml file You should define where the data (i.e. the Elasticsearch database) will be located on your operating system by adding the following lines in the elasticsearch section of your docker-compose file: volumes: - /path/to/data:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data Running ElasticSearch in production mode requires a minimum vm.max_map_count of 262144. ElasticSearch documentation provides instructions on how to query and change this value. If you want to make Cortex be available on TheHive, you must create an account on Cortex, define an API key for it and provide that key to TheHive container using parameter --cortex-key or environment TH_CORTEX_KEY . Manual Installation of Elasticsearch # Elasticsearch can be installed on the same server as TheHive or on a different one. You can then configure TheHive according to the documentation and run TheHive docker as follow: docker run --volume /path/to/thehive/application.conf:/etc/thehive/application.conf thehiveproject/thehive:latest --no-config You can add the --publish docker option to expose TheHive HTTP service. Customize the Docker Image # By default, the TheHive Docker image has minimal configuration: - choose a random secret ( play.http.secret.key ) - search for the Elasticsearch instance (host named elasticsearch ) and add it to configuration - search for a Cortex instance (host named cortex ) and add it to configuration This behavior can be disabled by adding --no-config to the Docker command line: docker run thehiveproject/thehive:latest --no-config Or by adding the line command: --no-config in the thehive section of docker-compose file. It is possible to start database migration at startup with the parameter --auto-migration . If the initial administrator doesn't exist yet, you can request its creation with --create-admin followed by the user login and its password. You can also create a normal user with --create-user followed by the user login and its roles and its password. The image accepts more options. All options are available using environment variables. For boolean variable, 1 means true and other value means false. For multivalued variables, values are separated by coma. This is possible only with --create-admin . Option Env variable Description --no-config TH_NO_CONFIG Do not try to configure TheHive (add the secret and Elasticsearch) --no-config-secret TH_NO_CONFIG_SECRET Do not add the random secret to the configuration --secret <secret> TH_SECRET Cryptographic secret needed to secure sessions --show-secret TH_SHOW_SECRET Show the generated secret --no-config-es TH_NO_CONFIG_ES Do not add the Elasticsearch hosts to configuration --es-uri <uri> TH_CONFIG_ES Use this string to configure elasticsearch hosts (format: http(s)://host:port,host:port(/prefix)?querystring) --es-hostname <host> TH_ES_HOSTNAME Resolve this hostname to find Elasticsearch instances --no-config-cortex TH_NO_CONFIG_CORTEX Do not add Cortex configuration --cortex-proto <proto> TH_CORTEX_PROTO Define the protocol to connect to Cortex (default: http ) --cortex-port <port> TH_CORTEX_PORT Define the port to connect to Cortex (default: 9001 ) --cortex-url <url> TH_CORTEX_URL Add the Cortex connection --cortex-hostname <host> TH_CORTEX_HOSTNAME Resolve this hostname to find the Cortex instance --cortex-key <key> TH_CORTEX_KEY Define Cortex key --auto-migration TH_AUTO_MIGRATION Migrate the database, if needed --create-admin <user> <password TH_CREATE_ADMIN_LOGIN TH_CREATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD Create the first admin user, if not exist yet --create-user <user> <role> <password> TH_CREATE_USER_LOGIN TH_CREATE_USER_ROLE TH_CREATE_USER_PASSWORD Create a user, only in conjunction with admin creation Note : please remember that you must install and configure Elasticsearch . What to Do Next? # Once the Docker image is up and running, proceed to the configuration using the Configuration Guide . For additional configuration options, please refer to the Administration Guide . Pre-release Versions # If you would like to use pre-release, beta versions of our Docker images and help us find bugs to the benefit of the whole community, please use thehiveproject/thehive:version-RCx . For example thehiveproject/thehive:3.1.0-RC1 . Binary # The following section contains the instructions to manually install TheHive using binaries on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS . 1. Minimal Ubuntu Installation # Install a minimal Ubuntu 20.04 system with the following software: Java runtime environment 1.8+ (JRE) Elasticsearch 7.x Make sure your system is up-to-date: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade 2. Install a Java Virtual Machine # You can install either Oracle Java or OpenJDK. The latter is recommended. sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jre-headless 3. Install Elasticsearch # To install Elasticsearch, please read the Elasticsearch Installation section below. 4. Install TheHive # Binary packages can be downloaded from Bintray . The latest version is called thehive-latest.zip . Download and unzip the chosen binary package. TheHive files can be installed wherever you want on the filesystem. In this guide, we assume you have chosen to install them under /opt . cd /opt wget https://download.thehive-project.org/thehive-latest.zip unzip thehive-latest.zip ln -s thehive-x.x.x thehive Note : if you would like to use pre-release, beta versions of and help us find bugs to the benefit of the whole community, please download https://download.thehive-project.org/thehive-version-RCx.zip . For example https://download.thehive-project.org/thehive-3.5.0-RC1-1.zip . 5. First start # It is recommended to use a dedicated, non-privileged user account to start TheHive. If so, make sure that the chosen account can create log files in /opt/thehive/logs . If you'd rather start the application as a service, use the following commands: sudo addgroup thehive sudo adduser --system thehive sudo cp /opt/thehive/package/thehive.service /usr/lib/systemd/system sudo chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thehive sudo chgrp thehive /etc/thehive/application.conf sudo chmod 640 /etc/thehive/application.conf sudo systemctl enable thehive sudo service thehive start The only required parameter in order to start TheHive is the key of the server ( play.http.secret.key ). This key is used to authenticate cookies that contain data. If TheHive runs in cluster mode, all instances must share the same key. You can generate the minimal configuration with the following commands (they assume that you have created a dedicated user for TheHive, named thehive ): sudo mkdir /etc/thehive ( cat << _EOF_ # Secret key # ~~~~~ # The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions. # If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key! play.http.secret.key=\"$(cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 64 | head -n 1)\" _EOF_ ) | sudo tee -a /etc/thehive/application.conf Now you can start TheHive. To do so, change your current directory to the TheHive installation directory ( /opt/thehive in this guide), then execute: bin/thehive -Dconfig.file = /etc/thehive/application.conf Please note that the service may take some time to start. Once it is started, you may launch your browser and connect to http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:9000/ . Please note that the service may take some time to start. The first time you connect you will have to create the database schema. Click \"Migrate database\" to create the DB schema. Once done, you should be redirected to the page for creating the administrator's account. Once created, you should be redirected to the login page. Warning : at this stage, if you missed the creation of the admin account, you will not be able to do it unless you delete TheHive's index from Elasticsearch. In the case you made a mistake, first find out what is the current index of TheHive by running the following command on a host where the Elasticsearch DB used by TheHive is located: $ curl http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/indices?v The indexes that TheHive uses always start with the_hive_ following by a number. Let's assume that the output of the command is: health status index uuid pri rep docs.count docs.deleted store.size pri.store.size yellow open cortex_1 PC_pLFGBS5G2TNQYr4ajgw 5 1 609 6 2 .1mb 2 .1mb yellow open the_hive_13 ft7GGTfhTr-4lSzZw5r1DQ 5 1 180131 3 51 .3mb 51 .3mb The index used by TheHive is the_hive_13 . To delete it, run the following command: $ curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:9200/the_hive_13 Then reload the page or restart TheHive. 6. Update # To update TheHive from binaries, just stop the service, download the latest package, rebuild the link /opt/thehive and restart the service. service thehive stop cd /opt wget https://download.thehive-project.org/thehive-latest.zip unzip thehive-latest.zip rm /opt/thehive && ln -s thehive-x.x.x thehive chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thehive /opt/thehive-x.x.x service thehive start 7. Configuration # To configure TheHive, read the Configuration Guide . For additional configuration options, please refer to the Administration Guide . Build it Yourself # The following section contains a step-by-step guide to build TheHive from its sources. 1. Pre-requisites # The following software are required to download and build TheHive: Java Development Kit 11 (JDK) git: use the system package or download it Node.js with its package manager (NPM) Grunt: after installing Node.js, run sudo npm install -g grunt-cli Bower: after installing Node.js, run sudo npm install -g bower Elasticsearch 5.6 2. Build # To install the requirements and build TheHive from sources, please follow the instructions below depending on your operating system. 2.1. CentOS/RHEL # Packages sudo yum -y install git bzip2 Installation of OpenJDK sudo yum -y install java-11-openjdk-devel Installation of Node.js Install the EPEL repository. You should have the extras repository enabled, then: sudo yum -y install epel-release Then, you can install Node.js, Grunt, and Bower: sudo yum -y install nodejs sudo npm install -g grunt-cli bower Installation of Elasticsearch To install Elasticsearch, please read the Elasticsearch Installation section below. 2.2. Ubuntu # Packages sudo apt-get install git wget Installation of Oracle JDK sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk-headless Installation of Node.js, Grunt and Bower sudo apt-get install curl curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash - sudo apt-get install -y nodejs sudo npm install -g grunt-cli bower Installation of Elasticsearch To install Elasticsearch, please read the Elasticsearch Installation section below. 2.3. TheHive # Download The Source git clone https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive.git Build the Project cd TheHive ./sbt clean stage This operation may take some time to complete as it will download all dependencies then build the back-end. This command cleans previous build files and creates an autonomous package in the target/universal/stage directory. This packages contains TheHive binaries with required libraries ( /lib ), configuration files ( /conf ) and startup scripts ( /bin ). Binaries are built and stored in TheHive/target/universal/stage/ . You can install them in /opt/thehive for example. sudo cp -r TheHive/target/universal/stage /opt/thehive Configure TheHive, read the Configuration Guide . For additional configuration options, please refer to the Administration Guide . 2.4 Configure and Start Elasticsearch # Edit /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml and add the following lines: http.host: 127.0.0.1 discovery.type: single-node cluster.name: hive thread_pool.search.queue_size: 100000 Start the service: service elasticsearch restart 3. First start # Follow the first start section of the binary installation method above to start using TheHive. 4. Build the Front-end Only # Building the back-end builds also the front-end, so you don't need to build it separately. This section is useful only for troubleshooting or for installing the front-end on a reverse proxy. Go to the front-end directory: cd TheHive/ui Install Node.js libraries, which are required by this step, bower libraries (JavaScript libraries downloaded by the browser). Then build the front-end : npm install bower install grunt build This step generates static files (HTML, JavaScript and related resources) in the dist directory. They can be readily imported on a HTTP server. Elasticsearch Installation # If, for some reason, you need to install Elasticsearch, it can be installed using a system package or a Docker image. Version 5.X must be used. From version 6, Elasticsearch drops mapping type . System Package # Install the Elasticsearch package provided by Elastic Debian, Ubuntu # # PGP key installation sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key D88E42B4 # Alternative PGP key installation # wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add - # Debian repository configuration echo \"deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main\" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list # Install https support for apt sudo apt install apt-transport-https # Elasticsearch installation sudo apt update && sudo apt install elasticsearch The Debian package does not start up the service by default, to prevent the instance from accidentally joining a cluster, without being configured appropriately. CentOS, RedHat, OpenSuSE # # PGP key installation sudo rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch Create the file elasticsearch.repo in /etc/yum.repos.d/ for RedHat and CentOS, or in /etc/zypp/repos.d/ for OpenSuSE distributions, and add the following lines: [elasticsearch-5.x] name=Elasticsearch repository for 7.x packages baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/yum gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch enabled=1 autorefresh=1 type=rpm-md Then, you can use the following command: # On CentOS and older Red Hat based distributions. sudo yum install elasticsearch # On Fedora and other newer Red Hat distributions. sudo dnf install elasticsearch # On OpenSUSE based distributions. sudo zypper install elasticsearch If you prefer using Elasticsearch inside a docker, see Elasticsearch inside a Docker . Configuration # It is highly recommended to avoid exposing this service to an untrusted zone. If Elasticsearch and TheHive run on the same host (and not in a docker), edit /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml and set network.host parameter with 127.0.0.1 . TheHive use dynamic scripts to make partial updates. Hence, they must be activated using script.inline: true . The cluster name must also be set ( hive for example). Threadpool queue size must be set with a high value ( 100000 ). The default size will get the queue easily overloaded. Edit /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml and add the following lines: http.host: 127.0.0.1 cluster.name: hive thread_pool.search.queue_size: 100000 Start the Service # Now that Elasticsearch is configured, start it as a service and check whether it's running: sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service sudo systemctl status elasticsearch.service The status should be active (running) . If it's not running, you can check for the reason in the logs: sudo journalctl -u elasticsearch.service Note that by default, the database is stored in /var/lib/elasticsearch and the logs in /var/log/elasticsearch Elasticsearch inside a Docker # You can also start Elasticsearch inside a docker. Use the following command and do not forget to specify the absolute path for persistent data on your host : docker run \\ --name elasticsearch \\ --hostname elasticsearch \\ --rm \\ --publish 127.0.0.1:9200:9200 \\ --volume ***DATA_DIR***:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data \\ -e \"http.host=0.0.0.0\" \\ -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" \\ -e \"xpack.security.enabled=false\" \\ -e \"cluster.name=hive\" \\ -e \"script.inline=true\" \\ -e \"thread_pool.index.queue_size=100000\" \\ -e \"thread_pool.search.queue_size=100000\" \\ -e \"thread_pool.bulk.queue_size=100000\" \\ docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.9.1","title":"Installation Guide"},{"location":"thehive/legacy/thehive3/installation/install-guide/#installation-guide","text":"\u26a0\ufe0f Please read carrefully this documentation.

By default, it is installed in /opt/thehive/bin/migrate . Pre-requisite # In order to migrate the data: TheHive 4 must be installed on the system running the migration tool; TheHive4 must be configured ; in particular database , index , and file storage ; The service thehive must be stopped ( service thehive stop ) on the target server. This tools must also have access to Elasticsearch database (http://ES:9200) used by TheHive 3, and the configuration file of TheHive 3.x instance. Configuration of TheHive 4 # Warning In TheHive4, users are identified by their email addresses. Thus, a domain will be appended to usernames in order to migrate users from TheHive 3. TheHive 4.x comes with a default domain named thehive.local . Starting the migration without explicitely specifying a domain name will result in migrating all users with a username formatted like user@thehive.local . Change the default domain name used to import existing users in the configuration file of TheHive4 ( /etc/thehive/application.conf ) ; add or update the setting named auth.defaultUserDomain : auth.defaultUserDomain : \"mydomain.com\" This way, the domain mydomain.com will be appended to user accounts imported from TheHive 3.4+ ( user@mydomain.com ). Run the migration # Prepare, install and configure your new instance of TheHive 4.x by following the associated guides . Once TheHive4 configuration file ( /etc/thehive/application.conf ) is correctly filled the migrate command ca be executed.

Accepted units are: DAY: d, day HOUR: h, hr, hour MINUTE: m, min, minute SECOND: s, sec, second MILLISECOND: ms, milli, millisecond Most of these options are filters you can apply to the program. For example, you could decide to import only some of the Cases/Alerts from your old instance: Import Cases/Alerts not older than X days/hours, Import Cases/Alerts with the ID number, Import part of Audit trail ... Taking the assumption that you are migrating a database hosted in a remote server, with TheHive 3, a basic command line to migrate data to a new instance will be like: /opt/thehive/bin/migrate \\ --output /etc/thehive/application.conf \\ --main-organisation myOrganisation \\ --es-uri http://ELASTICSEARCH_IP_ADDRESS:9200 \\ --es-index the_hive with: Option Description --output specifies the configuration file of TheHive 4.0 (the one that has previously been configured with at least, the database and file storage ) --main-organisation specifies the Organisation named myOrganisation to create during the migration. The tool will then create Users, Cases and Alerts from TheHive3 under that organisation; --es-uri specifies the URL of the Elasticsearch server. If using authentication on Elasticsearch, --input option with a configuration file for TheHive3 is required --es-index specifies the index used in Elasticsearch. Info The migration process can be very long, from several hours to several days, depending on the volume of data to migrate. We highly recommand to not start the application during the migration. Using authentication on Cassandra # if you are using a dedicated account on Cassandra to access TheHive 4 data, this user must have permissions to create keyspaces on the database: GRANT CREATE on ALL KEYSPACES to username ; Migration logs # The migration tool generates some logs during the process. By default, every 10 sec. a log is generated with information regarding the situation of the migration: [info] o.t.t.m.Migrate - [Migrate cases and alerts] CaseTemplate/Task:32 Organisation:1/1 Case/Task:160/201 Case:31/52 Job:103/138 ObservableType:3/17 Alert:25/235 Audit:3207/2986 CaseTemplate:6/6 Alert/Observable:700(52ms) Case/Observable:1325/1665 User:9/9 CustomField:13/13 Case/Task/Log:20/27 Numbers of Observables, Cases and others are estimations and not a definite value as computing these number can be very tedious. Files from MISP imported with TheHive 2.13 and earlier It is important to notice that migrating Cases/Alerts containing MISP event that were imported with TheHive 2.13 ( Sept 2017 ) or older, will cause observable files not being imported in TheHive 4. Indeed, until this version, TheHive referenced the file to the AttributeId in MISP and was not automatically downloaded. It then could generate a log like this: [warn] o.t.t.m.t.Input - Pre 2.13 file observables are ignored in MISP alert ffa3a8503ab0cd4f99fc6937a8e9b827 Starting TheHive 4 # Once the migration process is sucessfully completed, TheHive4 can be started.

The tool will then create Users, Cases and Alerts from TheHive3 under that organisation; --es-uri specifies the URL of the Elasticsearch server. If using authentication on Elasticsearch, --input option with a configuration file for TheHive3 is required --es-index specifies the index used in Elasticsearch.
